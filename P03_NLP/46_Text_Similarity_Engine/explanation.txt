Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we built a question answering system.

That system worked by
measuring similarity between
questions and sentences.

Today we generalize that idea.

Today’s topic is:
TEXT SIMILARITY ENGINE.

Text similarity measures
how close two texts are
in meaning.

This is used in:
search engines,
resume matching,
document clustering,
and plagiarism detection.

Now let us understand the core idea.

We convert text into vectors.

Each dimension represents a word.

The value represents
how many times the word appears.

Once we have vectors,
we measure the angle between them.

This is done using cosine similarity.

If two texts are similar,
their vectors point
in the same direction.

If they are different,
the angle is large.

Now let us look at the code.

First,
we tokenize text.

Then we convert text
into word frequency vectors.

Next,
we compute cosine similarity.

Cosine similarity returns a value
between zero and one.

One means identical.
Zero means completely different.

Now let us test the engine.

We give two sentences.

They use different words,
but the meaning is similar.

The similarity score is high.

This technique is simple,
fast,
and extremely useful.

Modern systems use embeddings
instead of raw word counts.

But the idea is the same.

Text similarity is the backbone
of many NLP applications.

In the next video,
we will use similarity
to group documents automatically.

That is called document clustering.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
