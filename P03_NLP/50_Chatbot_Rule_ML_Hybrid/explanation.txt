Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

This is the final video
of PART 3 — Natural Language Processing.

Today we are building
a complete chatbot.

Today’s topic is:
HYBRID CHATBOT — RULE + ML.

This chatbot combines
everything we have learned so far.

Let us first understand
why hybrid chatbots exist.

Pure rule-based chatbots
are fast and predictable.

But they are limited.

Pure machine learning chatbots
are flexible,
but harder to control.

Hybrid chatbots
combine the best of both worlds.

Now let us understand the architecture.

First,
we check for rule-based responses.

Simple greetings like
hello,
hi,
thanks,
and bye
are handled using rules.

Rules are very reliable
for fixed patterns.

Next,
if no rule matches,
we use ML-style logic.

We use text similarity.

The chatbot compares
the user input
with known questions.

The closest match
determines the response.

This is similar to
early intelligent chatbots
used in customer support.

Now let us look at the code.

We define a set of rules.

Then we define a knowledge base.

Each entry has:
a question,
and an answer.

When the user types a message,
the chatbot first checks rules.

If no rule matches,
it calculates cosine similarity
between the user input
and known questions.

If similarity is high,
the chatbot returns the answer.

If similarity is low,
the chatbot says
it did not understand.

Now let us test the chatbot.

We can greet it.
We can ask questions.
We can exit the conversation.

This chatbot uses:
tokenization,
vectorization,
cosine similarity,
rules,
and decision logic.

This single project
connects the entire NLP journey.

From tokenizers,
to embeddings,
to similarity,
to real systems.

With this,
you have completed
PART 3 of the AI curriculum.

You now understand
how machines read,
process,
and respond to language.

This is not the end.

This is the foundation
for advanced chatbots,
voice assistants,
and large language models.

Thank you for completing
this journey with me.

See you in the next advanced series.
