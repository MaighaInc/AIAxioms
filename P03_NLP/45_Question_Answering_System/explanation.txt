Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we learned text summarization.

Today we move to another
very important NLP task.

Today’s topic is:
QUESTION ANSWERING SYSTEM.

Question answering systems
allow machines to answer questions
based on a given passage of text.

This is used in:
search engines,
chatbots,
virtual assistants,
and help desks.

Now let us understand the idea.

We are NOT generating new text.

Instead,
we are extracting the answer
from existing text.

This is called
extractive question answering.

Now let us see how it works.

We take two inputs:
a question,
and a context passage.

The goal is to find
the sentence in the context
that best answers the question.

To do this,
we use text similarity.

Now let us look at the code.

First,
we tokenize the question
and each sentence in the context.

Then we convert words
into frequency vectors.

Next,
we compute similarity
between the question
and each sentence.

We use cosine similarity.

Cosine similarity measures
how similar two texts are
based on word overlap.

The sentence with the highest similarity
is chosen as the answer.

Now let us test the system.

We give a context paragraph
and a question.

The system correctly selects
the sentence that answers the question.

This is the foundation
of modern QA systems.

Advanced systems use transformers
to understand context deeply.

But even those systems
still perform sentence matching
internally.

In the next video,
we will build a text similarity engine,
which generalizes this idea further.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
