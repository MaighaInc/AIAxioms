Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we learned Part-of-Speech tagging.

Now we move to a higher-level NLP task.

Today’s topic is:
NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION,
also called NER.

NER is the task of identifying
real-world entities in text.

Examples of entities include:
people,
locations,
organizations,
dates,
and monetary values.

NER is extremely important.

It is used in:
search engines,
resume parsing,
chatbots,
news analysis,
and knowledge graphs.

Now let us understand the idea.

Given a sentence,
we want to find
which words refer to real objects.

For example:
John is a person.
India is a location.
OpenAI is an organization.

Now let us look at the code.

We build a simple NER system
using rules.

We maintain small lists of:
person names,
locations,
and organizations.

For each word in the sentence,
we check which list it belongs to.

If it matches a known entity,
we assign a label.

If it does not,
we label it as O,
which means outside any entity.

This is a rule-based NER system.

In real-world applications,
NER systems use machine learning
and deep learning models.

But even those models
follow the same idea:
identify patterns that represent entities.

NER builds on top of POS tagging.

POS helps understand grammar,
NER helps understand meaning.

In the next video,
we will combine what we learned
to build a full sentiment analysis system.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
