Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

So far in NLP,
we learned tokenization,
embeddings,
POS tagging,
and NER.

Now we put everything together
into a real application.

Today’s topic is:
SENTIMENT ANALYSIS SYSTEM.

Sentiment analysis means
understanding emotions in text.

For example:
reviews,
tweets,
comments,
and feedback.

Businesses use sentiment analysis
to understand customer opinions.

Now let us understand the approach.

We use a simple idea:
words carry sentiment.

Words like love, amazing, happy
usually indicate positive sentiment.

Words like hate, terrible, bad
usually indicate negative sentiment.

Now let us look at the code.

First,
we tokenize the text.

Then we count
how often each word appears
in positive and negative sentences.

During training,
we store word statistics
for each sentiment.

During prediction,
we score each sentiment class.

We add up the contribution
of every word.

The sentiment with the highest score
is chosen.

This is similar
to Naive Bayes logic,
but implemented manually.

Now let us test the system.

We give a new sentence.

The model correctly predicts
the sentiment.

Even with this simple approach,
the system works well
for small datasets.

Modern sentiment analysis systems
use transformers like BERT.

But the core idea remains the same:
extract features,
assign scores,
and choose the best class.

In the next video,
we will move to text summarization,
where machines learn
to shorten documents intelligently.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
