Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we learned how to tokenize text.

Today we take the next step.

Today’s topic is:
BAG-OF-WORDS TEXT CLASSIFIER.

Bag-of-Words is one of the oldest
and most important ideas in NLP.

Even modern models
are built on the same foundation.

Now let us understand the problem.

Machines do not understand words.

So we must convert text
into numbers.

Bag-of-Words does exactly that.

It ignores grammar and word order
and focuses only on
word frequency.

Now let us understand the idea.

First,
we build a vocabulary.

The vocabulary contains
all unique words
from the training data.

Next,
each sentence is converted
into a vector.

Each position in the vector
represents a word.

The value at that position
is how many times
the word appears.

This converts text
into numbers.

Now let us look at the code.

We created a BagOfWordsClassifier
from scratch.

We tokenize text
by converting it to lowercase
and splitting by spaces.

Then we build the vocabulary.

Next,
we count how many times
each word appears
for each class.

We use a simple probability-based scoring
to decide the class.

This idea is similar
to Naive Bayes,
but implemented manually.

Now let us test the model.

We give a new sentence:
win money offer.

Words like win and money
appear frequently in spam messages.

So the classifier predicts Spam.

Bag-of-Words is simple,
fast,
and effective for small problems.

But it has limitations.

It ignores word order
and meaning.

For example:
dog bites man
and
man bites dog
look the same.

To fix this,
we need better representations.

In the next video,
we will learn TF-IDF,
which improves Bag-of-Words
by weighting important words.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
