Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

So far,
we have learned neural networks
that classify, predict, and generate data.

But today,
we are learning something different.

Today’s topic is:
AUTOENCODER FOR ANOMALY DETECTION.

This is one of the most powerful
real-world applications
of deep learning.

Now let us understand the problem.

In many real systems,
we do NOT have labeled anomalies.

For example:
fraud transactions,
network attacks,
machine failures.

Anomalies are rare.

But normal behavior
is common.

So how do we detect anomalies?

The answer is:
learn what is normal.

This is exactly
what autoencoders do.

An autoencoder is trained
to reconstruct input data.

If the input is normal,
the reconstruction is good.

If the input is abnormal,
the reconstruction is poor.

This difference is called
reconstruction error.

Now let us look at the code.

First,
we generate normal data.

This represents normal system behavior.

Then we generate anomaly data.

Notice:
the autoencoder NEVER sees
the anomaly data during training.

This is very important.

We train the autoencoder
only on normal data.

The network learns
the normal pattern very well.

Next,
we pass both normal data
and anomaly data
through the autoencoder.

We calculate reconstruction error
for each input.

You will notice something important.

Normal data has low error.
Anomaly data has high error.

This difference allows us
to detect anomalies.

We then define a threshold.

Any data point
with error above the threshold
is considered an anomaly.

This technique is widely used in:
credit card fraud detection,
network intrusion detection,
sensor fault detection,
log monitoring.

The beauty of this approach
is that it does not require labels.

The model learns by itself
what is normal.

In the next video,
we will move to Variational Autoencoders,
which add probability and generation
to this idea.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
