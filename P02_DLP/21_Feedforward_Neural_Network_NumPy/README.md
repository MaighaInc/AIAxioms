Feedforward Neural Network (NumPy)
=================================

This project demonstrates how a basic neural network
works internally using NumPy only.

Requirements:
------------
- Python 3.x
- numpy

Install numpy:
--------------
pip install numpy

How to Run:
-----------
1. Open terminal
2. Navigate to this folder
3. Run:

   python feedforward_neural_network.py

Expected Output:
----------------
- Loss decreasing over epochs
- Correct predictions for AND gate

Learning Objective:
-------------------
Understand forward propagation,
activation functions,
and neural network structure
without deep learning frameworks.
