Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we learned about Autoencoders.

Autoencoders compress data
and reconstruct it.

But today,
we are going one level deeper.

Today’s topic is:
VARIATIONAL AUTOENCODER,
also known as VAE.

A Variational Autoencoder
is not just a compression model.

It is a generative model.

This means it can create new data.

Now let us understand
why VAE is different.

In a normal autoencoder,
the latent space is arbitrary.

There is no guarantee
that nearby points
produce meaningful outputs.

In a VAE,
the latent space is structured.

Instead of learning a single value,
the encoder learns a distribution.

Specifically,
it learns:
a mean,
and a variance.

This means every input
maps to a probability distribution,
not a single point.

Now let us understand the architecture.

The encoder outputs:
z_mean and z_log_variance.

From these,
we sample a latent vector.

This sampling step
is done using the
reparameterization trick.

This trick allows gradients
to flow during training.

Now let us look at the loss function.

VAE loss has two parts.

First is reconstruction loss.

This ensures the output
is similar to the input.

Second is KL divergence loss.

This forces the latent space
to follow a normal distribution.

This is extremely important.

It ensures the latent space
is smooth and continuous.

Because of this,
we can sample random points
and generate new data.

Now let us look at the code.

We generate simple 2D data.

The encoder compresses the data
into a 2D latent space.

The decoder reconstructs it.

After training,
we generate new data points
by sampling from the latent space.

These generated points
look similar to the original data.

VAEs are used in:
image generation,
anomaly detection,
data augmentation,
and representation learning.

VAEs are the foundation
for many modern generative models.

In the next video,
we will learn about
Transfer Learning with ResNet,
where we reuse powerful pretrained models.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
