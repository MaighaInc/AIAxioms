Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we built a CNN for digit recognition.

Digits are simple images.

But real-world images are much harder.

Today’s topic is:
CNN FOR IMAGE CLASSIFICATION.

This is where deep learning
becomes truly powerful.

We use the CIFAR-10 dataset,
which contains real color images.

Each image is 32 by 32 pixels
with three color channels:
red, green, and blue.

This makes the problem
much more complex than MNIST.

For simplicity,
we convert this into a binary problem:
airplane versus automobile.

Now let us walk through the code.

We load the CIFAR-10 dataset
directly from Keras.

Then we filter the dataset
to keep only two classes.

Next,
we normalize pixel values
between 0 and 1.

Now we build the CNN.

The first convolution layer
extracts low-level features
like edges and corners.

The second convolution layer
extracts more complex patterns
like shapes.

MaxPooling reduces image size
while keeping important features.

After convolution,
we flatten the feature maps
and pass them to Dense layers.

The final layer uses sigmoid
because this is binary classification.

We compile the model
using binary cross-entropy loss.

Then we train the model.

You will see accuracy improve
as the network learns visual patterns.

Finally,
we evaluate the model
on unseen images.

This exact pipeline
is used in real-world applications
like object detection
and image moderation.

In the next video,
we will move from images
to sequences using RNNs.

This is where time and order matter.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
