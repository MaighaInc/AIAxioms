Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

So far in deep learning,
we worked with images.

Images are static.

But many real-world problems
are not static.

They involve sequences.

Today’s topic is:
RNN SEQUENCE PREDICTOR.

RNN stands for Recurrent Neural Network.

The key difference between RNNs
and normal neural networks
is memory.

An RNN remembers
what happened in previous steps.

Now let us understand the problem.

Given a sequence of numbers:
1, 2, 3

We want the model to predict:
4

This may look trivial,
but the concept is powerful.

This same idea applies to:
stock prices,
weather forecasting,
speech recognition,
and language translation.

Now let us look at the code.

First,
we generate sequence data.

Each input has three time steps.
The target is the next value.

Next,
we normalize the data
to keep training stable.

Then we reshape the data.

This step is very important.

RNNs expect input in the form:
samples,
time steps,
features.

Now let us build the model.

We use SimpleRNN,
which is the most basic RNN unit.

It processes one time step at a time
and passes hidden state forward.

This hidden state is the memory.

After the RNN layer,
we use a Dense layer
to produce the final output.

We compile the model
using mean squared error loss.

Then we train the model.

During training,
the RNN learns
the pattern of increasing numbers.

Finally,
we test the model
with a new sequence.

The predicted value
is very close to the correct answer.

Now let us talk about limitations.

Simple RNNs suffer from
vanishing gradient problem.

They struggle with long sequences.

To solve this,
advanced architectures were created.

In the next video,
we will learn about LSTM networks,
which are designed to remember long-term patterns.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
