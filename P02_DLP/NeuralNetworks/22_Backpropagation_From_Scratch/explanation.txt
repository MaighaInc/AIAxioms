Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

This is the most important video
in the entire deep learning series.

Today’s topic is:
BACKPROPAGATION FROM SCRATCH.

If you understand this video clearly,
you will understand how every neural network learns.

Now let me say something very clearly.

Backpropagation is NOT magic.
It is just calculus applied carefully.

Now let us understand the problem.

In the previous video,
our neural network made predictions.

But how does it improve?

How does it know
which weights are wrong
and by how much?

That answer is backpropagation.

Backpropagation means:
propagating the error backward.

Now let us understand the flow.

First,
the network performs forward propagation.

It produces an output.

Then,
we calculate loss.

Loss tells us
how wrong the prediction is.

Now the key question:
Which weight caused this error?

To answer this,
we move backward,
layer by layer.

Let us look at the code.

We start at the output layer.

We calculate the error:
prediction minus actual value.

Then we multiply it
by the derivative of sigmoid.

This tells us
how sensitive the output is.

Next,
we calculate gradients
for the output layer weights.

These gradients tell us
how much each weight contributed
to the error.

Then we move backward
to the hidden layer.

We distribute the error
using the weights.

Again,
we multiply by sigmoid derivative.

This gives us hidden layer gradients.

Finally,
we update all weights and biases.

This update moves the network
toward lower error.

Now notice something very important.

We never told the network
how to solve XOR.

XOR is not linearly separable.

A single neuron cannot solve it.

But with backpropagation
and a hidden layer,
the network learns it.

This proves the power
of multi-layer neural networks.

Backpropagation is used in:
CNNs,
RNNs,
LSTMs,
Transformers,
and every deep learning model.

In the next video,
we will build a real image classifier
using a multilayer perceptron.

From here,
everything becomes visual and exciting.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
