Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we built an image classifier using MLP.

It worked,
but it had serious limitations.

Today’s topic solves those limitations.

Today we are learning:
CNN FOR DIGIT RECOGNITION.

CNN stands for Convolutional Neural Network.

CNNs were designed specifically
to work with images.

Now let me explain the key problem with MLPs.

MLPs flatten images.

This destroys spatial information.

A CNN does NOT flatten images initially.

It looks at images as 2D structures.

Now let us understand convolution.

A convolution layer uses filters,
also called kernels.

These filters slide over the image
and detect patterns.

Early filters detect edges.

Deeper layers detect shapes.

Even deeper layers detect objects.

This is how CNNs see images.

Now let us walk through the code.

We use the MNIST dataset.

Each image is 28 by 28 pixels.

We normalize pixel values
to make training stable.

Then we build the CNN.

First layer is Conv2D with 32 filters.
Each filter is 3 by 3.

Then we apply MaxPooling.

Pooling reduces image size
and keeps important information.

Then we repeat the process
with more filters.

After convolution layers,
we flatten the feature maps.

Then we use Dense layers
for classification.

At the end,
we use softmax
to output probabilities
for digits 0 to 9.

We compile the model
using Adam optimizer.

Adam is fast and stable.

We train the model
for a few epochs.

Even with few epochs,
the accuracy becomes very high.

Finally,
we evaluate the model
on test data.

CNNs are the backbone of:
image recognition,
face detection,
medical imaging,
self-driving cars.

In the next video,
we will extend CNNs
to general image classification.

This will move us
from digits to real images.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
