Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

This is one of the most important videos
in the entire AI course.

Today’s topic is:
FINE-TUNING BERT.

BERT changed the world of NLP.

Before BERT,
models read text left to right.

But BERT reads text
in both directions.

This allows it to understand
context much better.

Now let us understand
what BERT really is.

BERT stands for
Bidirectional Encoder Representations
from Transformers.

It is a transformer-based model
trained on massive text data.

BERT already understands language.

So we do NOT train it from scratch.

Instead,
we fine-tune it.

Fine-tuning means:
slightly adjusting the model
for our specific task.

Now let us look at the problem.

We want to perform
sentiment analysis.

Given a sentence,
predict whether it is
positive or negative.

Now let us walk through the code.

First,
we load a pretrained tokenizer.

The tokenizer converts text
into tokens that BERT understands.

This includes:
token IDs,
attention masks,
and padding.

Next,
we create a dataset class.

This allows the Trainer
to load data properly.

Then we load the pretrained BERT model.

Notice something important.

We specify num_labels as 2.

This automatically adds
a classification head
on top of BERT.

Now we define training arguments.

We specify:
number of epochs,
batch size,
and logging options.

Then we use the Trainer API.

This handles:
training,
backpropagation,
and optimization for us.

After training,
we test the model
with a new sentence.

The model predicts sentiment correctly.

This is extremely powerful.

With just a few lines of code,
we fine-tuned one of the strongest
language models in the world.

BERT is used in:
search engines,
chatbots,
recommendation systems,
and document analysis.

In the next videos,
we will go deeper
into how transformers work internally.

We will build attention
and transformer blocks from scratch.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
