Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

This video is extremely important.

Today’s topic is:
ATTENTION MECHANISM FROM SCRATCH.

Attention is the heart
of modern AI models like:
Transformers,
BERT,
GPT,
and ChatGPT.

If you understand attention,
you understand modern AI.

Now let me explain the problem
attention is trying to solve.

Earlier models like RNNs
processed sequences step by step.

This made them slow
and bad at long-range relationships.

Attention solves this problem.

Attention allows the model
to look at all inputs at once
and decide what is important.

Now let us understand the idea intuitively.

Imagine reading a sentence.

When you read a word,
you automatically focus on
other relevant words in the sentence.

That is attention.

Now let us break attention
into three parts.

Query.
Key.
Value.

Query represents:
what we are looking for.

Key represents:
what each word contains.

Value represents:
the actual information we want.

Now let us look at the code.

We start with embeddings
for three words.

Each word has:
a key vector,
and a value vector.

We also define a query vector.

This query asks:
which words are relevant to me?

Now we compute attention scores.

We do this using dot product
between query and each key.

Higher score means
higher relevance.

Next,
we apply softmax.

Softmax converts scores
into probabilities.

These probabilities
are called attention weights.

Finally,
we compute the output.

The output is
a weighted sum of values.

Words with higher attention weight
contribute more.

This is the entire attention mechanism.

There is no magic.

Just dot products,
softmax,
and weighted sums.

This simple idea
revolutionized deep learning.

In real transformers,
this process happens
many times in parallel,
which is called multi-head attention.

But the core idea
is exactly what we saw today.

In the next video,
we will use this attention mechanism
to build a mini Transformer Encoder.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
