Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we learned Word2Vec.

Word2Vec learns word meaning
using local context.

Today we learn another
important embedding method.

Today’s topic is:
GLOVE-STYLE WORD EMBEDDINGS.

GloVe stands for
Global Vectors for Word Representation.

The key idea of GloVe is simple.

Instead of predicting context,
GloVe looks at
how often words appear together
across the entire corpus.

This is called
global co-occurrence statistics.

Now let us understand the intuition.

If two words
often appear together,
they are likely related.

For example:
deep and learning,
nlp and language,
king and queen.

GloVe captures this relationship
numerically.

Now let us look at the code.

First,
we build a co-occurrence matrix.

This matrix counts
how many times
word pairs appear together
within a window.

Next,
we train the GloVe model.

The model learns vectors
so that the dot product
matches the log of co-occurrence counts.

This is very important.

It means vector relationships
encode statistical relationships.

Unlike Word2Vec,
GloVe does not predict words.

It directly factorizes
the co-occurrence matrix.

This makes GloVe very stable
and efficient for large corpora.

After training,
each word has an embedding.

Words that appear in similar contexts
have similar vectors.

GloVe embeddings are widely used
in:
text classification,
information retrieval,
sentiment analysis,
and question answering.

In the next video,
we will move from embeddings
to linguistic structure
by building a POS tagger.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
