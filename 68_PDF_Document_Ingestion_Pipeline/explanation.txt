Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we built a vector search engine.

Now we move from toy examples
to real-world data.

Today’s topic is:
PDF DOCUMENT INGESTION PIPELINE.

This is a critical step in RAG systems.

LLMs do not read PDFs directly.

They need clean,
structured text.

So we must ingest documents properly.

Now let us understand the ingestion flow.

First,
we read the PDF file.

Second,
we extract raw text
from each page.

Third,
we split the text into chunks.

Why do we chunk text?

LLMs and embedding models
have context limits.

If we send an entire PDF at once,
it will not fit.

Chunking allows us
to retrieve only
the relevant parts later.

Now let us look at the code.

We use PyPDF2
to read the PDF file.

We loop through each page
and extract text.

Then we split the text
into fixed-size word chunks.

Each chunk becomes
a retrievable knowledge unit.

These chunks will later be:
converted to embeddings,
stored in a vector database,
and retrieved during question answering.

PDF ingestion is used in:
enterprise knowledge systems,
legal document analysis,
research assistants,
and internal chatbots.

If ingestion is poor,
retrieval will fail.

This is why this step
is extremely important.

In the next video,
we will connect retrieval
and generation
to build a full RAG chatbot
over documents.

That is where everything comes together.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
