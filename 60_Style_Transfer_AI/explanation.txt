Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we learned image captioning,
where AI describes images.

Today we do something creative.

Today’s topic is:
STYLE TRANSFER AI.

Style transfer allows AI
to take one image’s content
and another image’s style
and combine them.

For example:
a photo of a city
painted like Van Gogh.

Now let us understand the key idea.

Neural style transfer separates:
what is in the image,
and how it looks.

The content represents structure.
The style represents texture and colors.

Now let us understand the architecture.

A deep neural network
extracts features from an image.

Lower layers capture content.
Higher layers capture style patterns.

The model then generates a new image
that preserves content
but matches the style.

Now let us look at the simplified code.

We simulate content extraction.

Then we simulate style extraction.

Finally,
we combine them into a new image.

This matches exactly
how real style transfer works conceptually.

Style transfer is used in:
photo editing,
creative tools,
filters,
and generative art.

Modern systems perform style transfer
in real time using deep networks.

In the next section,
we move from models
to real LLM APIs and tooling.

We will build:
wrappers,
chains,
tool-using agents,
and safety systems.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
