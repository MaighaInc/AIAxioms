Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we learned about the attention mechanism.

Today we take the next big step.

Today’s topic is:
TRANSFORMER ENCODER FROM SCRATCH.

This is one of the most important
architectures in modern AI.

Let us first understand
what a Transformer Encoder does.

A Transformer Encoder
takes input tokens
and converts them
into rich contextual representations.

Each token learns information
about every other token.

Now let us break down the encoder.

A Transformer Encoder has
four main components:

1. Self-attention
2. Residual connection
3. Feedforward network
4. Layer normalization

Now let us walk through the code.

We start with input embeddings.

Each row represents a token.
Each column represents an embedding dimension.

First,
we create Query, Key, and Value matrices.

These are learned projections
of the input.

Then we apply self-attention.

Each token attends to all tokens,
including itself.

Next,
we add a residual connection.

Residual connection means
we add the original input
to the attention output.

This helps with gradient flow
and stable training.

Then we apply layer normalization.

Layer normalization keeps values
numerically stable.

Next,
we apply a feedforward network.

This is a simple neural network
applied independently
to each token.

Again,
we add a residual connection.

Again,
we apply layer normalization.

The final output
is the encoded representation.

This output is passed
to the next encoder layer
or to a decoder.

This exact structure
is repeated many times
in real Transformers.

BERT uses only encoder blocks.
GPT uses decoder blocks.

Now you understand
what is inside them.

In the next video,
we will build a mini Transformer Decoder
and complete the Transformer architecture.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
