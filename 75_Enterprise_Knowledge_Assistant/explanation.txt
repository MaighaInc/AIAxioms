Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

This is the final video
of PART 5 — RAG.

Today we build the
ENTERPRISE KNOWLEDGE ASSISTANT.

This system represents
how real companies use GenAI.

Let us review the problem.

Organizations have:
policies,
reports,
documents,
and internal knowledge.

LLMs alone cannot access this data.

RAG solves that.

Now let us understand
the full architecture.

First,
documents are ingested and chunked.

Second,
text is converted into embeddings.

Third,
documents are stored
with metadata.

Fourth,
when a user asks a question,
we apply metadata filters.

Fifth,
we retrieve relevant chunks
using vector similarity.

Sixth,
we generate an answer
from retrieved content.

Seventh,
we stream the answer
to the user.

Finally,
we attach citations
for transparency.

Now let us look at the code.

This program combines:
retrieval,
metadata filtering,
streaming,
and citations.

The assistant only retrieves
documents from the correct department.

It streams answers word by word.

It clearly shows
where information came from.

This is exactly how
enterprise AI assistants work.

Such systems are used for:
HR assistants,
finance analysis,
technical documentation,
and internal support.

With this lesson,
you have completed PART 5.

You now understand
how RAG works
from first principles
to enterprise deployment.

This knowledge puts you
far ahead of most practitioners.

In the next part,
we can move to:
agents,
memory,
autonomous workflows,
and advanced architectures.

Thank you for watching.
Congratulations on completing
PART 5 — RAG.
