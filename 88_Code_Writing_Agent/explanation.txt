Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we built a web-browsing agent.

Now we enter
one of the most powerful applications of AI.

Today’s topic is:
CODE-WRITING AI AGENT.

This is how coding assistants work.

Now let us understand the pipeline.

First,
the agent receives a coding task.

Second,
it plans what needs to be written.

Third,
it generates code.

In advanced systems,
this loop repeats
until the code works correctly.

Now let us look at the code.

The plan method
interprets the task.

The write_code method
returns Python code.

This example is simple,
but the idea scales.

Modern agents:
generate full applications,
write tests,
and refactor code.

This architecture powers:
GitHub Copilot,
Cursor,
and coding copilots.

In the next video,
we will let agents debug code.

That is how AI becomes a real developer assistant.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
