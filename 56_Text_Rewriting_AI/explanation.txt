Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we learned text completion.

Now we move to a very popular
GenAI application.

Today’s topic is:
TEXT REWRITING AI.

Text rewriting means
taking an input sentence
and generating a modified version
without changing the meaning.

This includes:
paraphrasing,
simplifying,
changing tone,
and correcting grammar.

Now let us understand the key idea.

Text rewriting is not random generation.

It is controlled generation.

The model must preserve meaning
but change expression.

Now let us look at the approach.

In real LLMs,
rewriting is done using prompts like:
rewrite this politely,
simplify this text,
or make this more professional.

Internally,
the model still does
next-token prediction.

But the prompt constrains the output.

In this lesson,
we demonstrate the idea
using simple rewrite rules.

We replace certain words
with alternative expressions.

Now let us look at the code.

We define a dictionary
of rewrite rules.

During rewriting,
we scan each word.

If the word has a rewrite rule,
we replace it.

Otherwise,
we keep it unchanged.

The output is a rewritten sentence.

Now let us test the system.

The sentence is rewritten
with improved wording.

This may look simple,
but the logic matches
real-world systems.

Modern LLMs do this
using probability distributions
instead of fixed rules.

But the goal is the same:
controlled transformation.

In the next video,
we will build a
code generation assistant,
where text generation
creates executable programs.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
