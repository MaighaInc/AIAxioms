Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

This is one of the most important videos
in the entire course.

Today’s topic is:
PLANNING AGENT USING ReAct.

ReAct stands for:
Reason + Act.

Earlier agents reacted immediately.

But real intelligence requires thinking.

Now let us understand the ReAct loop.

Step one:
the agent receives a task.

Step two:
the agent thinks about what to do.

Step three:
the agent performs an action.

Step four:
the agent observes the result.

Step five:
the agent decides the next step.

This loop continues until the task is solved.

Now let us look at the code.

We define two tools:
a search tool
and a calculator tool.

The agent first produces a thought.

This thought determines
which tool to use.

Then the agent performs the action.

The result of the action
is the observation.

Finally,
the agent produces the answer.

This architecture is used in:
AutoGPT,
LangChain agents,
and advanced copilots.

This is where AI starts
to resemble human problem solving.

In the next video,
we will build an autonomous research agent.

This agent will search,
summarize,
and decide on its own.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
