Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

This is the final video
of PART 7 — AI AGENTS.

Today we build the
MULTI-STEP TASK EXECUTOR.

This agent represents
the culmination of everything
we have learned so far.

Let us understand the problem.

Real-world tasks
are not single actions.

They are sequences of steps.

An agent must:
understand the goal,
plan steps,
execute each step,
and track progress.

Now let us understand the architecture.

First,
the agent receives a goal.

Second,
it breaks the goal into steps.

Third,
it executes each step in order.

Fourth,
it collects results.

This loop continues
until the goal is completed.

Now let us look at the code.

The plan method
breaks the goal into steps.

The execute_step method
performs each action.

The run method
orchestrates everything.

This is the foundation of:
AutoGPT,
BabyAGI,
LangGraph,
and autonomous systems.

With this lesson,
you have completed PART 7.

You now understand:
agents,
tools,
planning,
autonomy,
debugging,
and multi-step execution.

This puts you in
the top tier of AI practitioners.

Thank you for watching.
Congratulations on completing
PART 7 — AI AGENTS.
