Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we built an autonomous research agent.

Now we make agents interact
with the live world.

Today’s topic is:
WEB-BROWSING AI AGENT.

Web-browsing agents allow AI
to access real-time information.

This is critical because
LLMs have knowledge cutoffs.

Browsing fills that gap.

Now let us understand the flow.

The agent receives a topic.

It decides which webpage to visit.

It fetches page content.

It extracts relevant information.

Now let us look at the code.

We simulate a browser.

The browser fetches
content based on a URL.

The agent decides
which URL matches the topic.

Then it retrieves the content.

In production systems,
this is replaced by:
headless browsers,
HTTP clients,
and HTML parsers.

Web-browsing agents are used in:
news aggregation,
research assistants,
competitive analysis,
and monitoring systems.

In the next video,
we will let agents write code.

That is how coding copilots work.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
