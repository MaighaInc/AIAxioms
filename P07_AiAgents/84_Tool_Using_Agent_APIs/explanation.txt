Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we built a single-task AI agent.

That agent could perform one task.

Today we take a big step forward.

Today’s topic is:
TOOL-USING AI AGENT.

Modern AI agents are powerful
because they can use tools.

Tools allow agents to:
calculate numbers,
call APIs,
query databases,
and control systems.

Now let us understand the architecture.

The agent receives a task.

It analyzes the task.

Then it decides:
Do I need a tool?

If yes,
it selects the correct tool
and executes it.

If not,
it responds using reasoning.

Now let us look at the code.

We define two tools:
a calculator API
and a weather API.

The agent maintains a list of tools.

When a task arrives,
the agent inspects the task text.

If the task requires calculation,
it uses the calculator.

If the task asks for weather,
it calls the weather API.

Otherwise,
it responds without tools.

This decision-making logic
is at the heart of agent systems.

This is how ChatGPT:
uses calculators,
browsers,
and code interpreters.

In the next video,
we will introduce planning.

The agent will think step-by-step
before acting.

This is called the ReAct pattern.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
