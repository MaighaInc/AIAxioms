Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we built a planning agent using ReAct.

Now we go one level higher.

Today’s topic is:
AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH AGENT.

This agent does not wait
for detailed instructions.

You give it a topic,
and it figures out:
what to search,
how to search,
and how to summarize.

Now let us understand the pipeline.

Step one:
the agent receives a topic.

Step two:
it plans research questions.

Step three:
it searches for answers.

Step four:
it consolidates findings.

Step five:
it produces a final summary.

Now let us look at the code.

The plan method breaks a topic
into meaningful questions.

The research method
searches each question.

The summarize method
combines results into insight.

This is how research copilots work.

Such agents are used in:
market research,
technical analysis,
academic assistance,
and competitive intelligence.

In the next video,
we will allow agents
to browse the web.

This brings real-time information
into agent workflows.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
