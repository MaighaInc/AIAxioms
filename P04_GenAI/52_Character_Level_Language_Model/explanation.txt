Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we built a Markov chain text generator.

That model looked only one step ahead.

Today we move to neural networks.

Today’s topic is:
CHARACTER-LEVEL LANGUAGE MODEL.

This is where modern text generation begins.

Instead of predicting words,
we predict characters.

Why characters?

Characters avoid tokenization issues
and let the model learn spelling,
punctuation,
and structure.

Now let us understand the approach.

We take a small piece of text.

We create a vocabulary of characters.

Each character is converted
into a numerical index.

Then we create sequences.

For example,
given 10 characters,
the model predicts the 11th.

This is sequence prediction.

Now let us look at the model.

We use a Simple RNN layer.

RNNs have memory.

They remember previous characters
while predicting the next one.

After the RNN,
we use a Dense layer with softmax.

Softmax outputs probabilities
for every possible character.

During training,
the model learns patterns like:
which characters follow others.

After training,
we generate text.

We start with a seed string.

The model predicts the next character.

We append it
and feed it back to the model.

This loop creates new text
character by character.

You will notice something important.

The text is not copied.

It is generated.

It follows the style and structure
of the training data.

This is real generative behavior.

Character-level models have limitations.

They struggle with long-term meaning.

To fix that,
we move to larger context models.

In the next video,
we will build a
GPT-style mini language model.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
