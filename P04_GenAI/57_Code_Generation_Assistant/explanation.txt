Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we learned text rewriting.

Now we move to one of the most
popular GenAI applications today.

Today’s topic is:
CODE GENERATION ASSISTANT.

Tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot
are changing how programmers work.

But how does AI generate code?

Let us break it down.

Code is just structured text.

Programming languages follow
patterns and rules.

AI models learn these patterns
from large amounts of code.

Now let us understand the idea.

The user gives an instruction.

For example:
write a function to add two numbers.

The model maps this instruction
to a known code pattern.

Then it generates the code
token by token.

Now let us look at the code.

In this lesson,
we simulate a code generation assistant.

We check the instruction text.

If the instruction matches
a known task,
we return a code template.

This is rule-based generation.

Real LLMs do the same thing,
but using probability instead of rules.

They have seen millions of examples
of similar instructions and code.

So when you ask for code,
they predict the most likely
next token sequence.

Now let us test the assistant.

We give different instructions.

The assistant generates
working Python code.

This is how AI helps developers:
writing boilerplate,
suggesting logic,
and speeding up development.

In the next video,
we will move beyond text
and enter image generation,
starting with diffusion basics.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
