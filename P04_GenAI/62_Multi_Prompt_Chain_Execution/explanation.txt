Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we built an LLM wrapper.

That wrapper allowed us
to talk to language models cleanly.

Today we go one step further.

Today’s topic is:
MULTI-PROMPT CHAIN EXECUTION.

This is how LLMs are made
to solve complex tasks.

LLMs are not good
at doing everything in one step.

But they are very good
at following instructions step by step.

Prompt chaining uses this strength.

Now let us understand the idea.

Instead of one big prompt,
we break the task into steps.

Each step produces an output.

That output becomes the input
for the next step.

This creates a chain.

For example:
first summarize,
then extract key points,
then generate a title.

Now let us look at the code.

We define a PromptChain class.

It holds a list of prompt templates.

Each template uses
the output of the previous step.

We start with input text.

Then we execute each step
one by one.

The final output
is the result of the entire chain.

This approach is extremely powerful.

It improves:
accuracy,
reasoning,
and control.

Modern frameworks like LangChain
are built entirely on this idea.

In the next video,
we will demonstrate
few-shot learning.

This shows how LLMs
learn from examples inside prompts.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
