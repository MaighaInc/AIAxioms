- tensorflow
- numpy

Install dependencies:
---------------------
pip install tensorflow numpy

How to Run:
-----------
1. Open terminal
2. Navigate to this folder
3. Run:

   python char_level_language_model.py

Expected Output:
----------------
- Generated text similar to training data

Learning Objective:
-------------------
Understand how RNNs learn sequential
patterns for text generation.
