Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we built a GPT-style mini language model.

Now we answer a very important question.

Why do prompts matter so much?

Today’s topic is:
PROMPT ENGINEERING EXPERIMENTS.

Prompt engineering is the art
of asking the right question
in the right way.

Modern GenAI systems
are extremely sensitive to input.

The same model can behave
very differently
based on how you phrase the prompt.

Now let us understand why.

Language models do one thing:
predict the next token.

They don’t know what you want.

They only react to patterns
in your input.

The prompt defines the pattern.

Now let us look at the code.

We simulate a simple language model.

The model checks
what kind of instruction
the prompt contains.

If the prompt says explain,
the output is detailed.

If the prompt says summarize,
the output is short.

If the prompt asks for steps,
the output becomes procedural.

This is exactly how real LLMs behave.

The model is the same.
Only the prompt changes.

This is why prompt engineering
is now a valuable skill.

Developers use it to:
control tone,
control length,
control format,
and control reasoning.

In real systems,
you combine prompt engineering
with system messages
and examples.

In the next video,
we will build a
text completion engine,
which is the core service
offered by LLM APIs.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
