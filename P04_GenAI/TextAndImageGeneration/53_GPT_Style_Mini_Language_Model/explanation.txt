Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

This video is a major milestone.

Today’s topic is:
GPT-STYLE MINI LANGUAGE MODEL.

If you understand this video,
you understand the foundation
of ChatGPT and GPT-4.

Now let us understand the big idea.

GPT models are
decoder-only Transformers.

They do one thing very well:
predict the next token.

They do this repeatedly
to generate text.

Now let us break down the architecture.

The core component is
causal self-attention.

Causal means:
the model can only look
at previous tokens,
not future ones.

This ensures proper
text generation.

Self-attention means:
each token attends
to all previous tokens
and decides what matters.

This allows the model
to understand context.

Now let us look at the code.

We create a character-level dataset
for simplicity.

Each input sequence predicts
the next character.

Instead of RNNs,
we use attention.

The attention layer computes:
queries,
keys,
and values.

It then applies a mask
to block future positions.

This mask is the heart of GPT.

After attention,
we predict the next character.

During generation,
we feed the output back
into the model.

This loop creates new text.

Even though this is a tiny model,
the behavior is the same
as real GPT models.

The difference is scale,
not concept.

Modern GPT models
use billions of parameters
and massive datasets.

But internally,
they do exactly what you saw today.

In the next video,
we will experiment with
prompt engineering
and see how prompts
change model behavior.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
