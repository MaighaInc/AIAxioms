Markov Chain Text Generator
==========================

This project demonstrates how text
can be generated using probability
and word transitions.

Requirements:
------------
- Python 3.x

How to Run:
-----------
1. Open terminal
2. Navigate to this folder
3. Run:

   python markov_chain_text_generator.py

Expected Output:
----------------
- New text generated from learned transitions

Learning Objective:
-------------------
Understand how probabilistic text
generation works before neural networks.
