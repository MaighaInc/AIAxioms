Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

Now we are entering
the visual side of Generative AI.

Today’s topic is:
IMAGE GENERATION USING DIFFUSION BASICS.

Models like Stable Diffusion
and DALL·E
generate images in a very surprising way.

They do not draw images directly.

They start from noise.

Let us understand this step by step.

First,
what is diffusion?

Diffusion is a process
where noise is gradually added
to an image until it becomes pure noise.

The model learns
how to reverse this process.

That means:
how to remove noise step by step.

Now let us look at the key idea.

Image generation works like this:

Start with random noise.
Remove a little noise.
Repeat this many times.
An image slowly appears.

This may sound strange,
but it works extremely well.

Now let us look at the code.

We simulate this idea.

We start with a random matrix.
This represents pure noise.

Then,
in each step,
we apply a denoising operation.

In real models,
this denoising is done
using a neural network.

Here,
we simulate it using simple math.

After many steps,
the image becomes structured.

This is exactly how
real diffusion models work.

The difference is:
real models use
millions of parameters,
trained on huge datasets.

But the logic is the same.

Diffusion models are used in:
image generation,
image editing,
inpainting,
and style transfer.

In the next video,
we will connect vision and language
by building an image captioning model.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
