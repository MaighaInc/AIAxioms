Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we learned prompt engineering.

Now we move to the engine
that powers every LLM API.

Today’s topic is:
TEXT COMPLETION ENGINE.

When you use ChatGPT,
or any LLM API,
you are not asking it to think.

You are asking it to complete text.

Everything is text completion.

Now let us understand how it works.

You provide a prompt.

The model predicts the next token.

That token is appended
to the prompt.

Then the process repeats.

This loop continues
until a stop condition is reached.

This is exactly how GPT works.

Now let us look at the code.

We train a simple model
on word transitions.

During completion,
we start from the last word
of the prompt.

We then predict the next word
based on learned probabilities.

Each prediction updates the context.

This is the completion loop.

Even though this model is simple,
the behavior matches real systems.

The difference between this
and GPT-4
is scale, not logic.

Modern systems use:
transformers,
large datasets,
and sampling strategies.

But the core idea remains the same.

Everything is text completion.

In the next video,
we will build a text rewriting AI,
which uses completion in a controlled way.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
