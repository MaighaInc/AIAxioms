Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

We have now entered
the LLM API section.

This is where models
turn into real products.

Today’s topic is:
OPENAI-COMPATIBLE LLM WRAPPER.

Modern GenAI applications
do not talk directly to models.

They talk to APIs.

Whether it is OpenAI,
Azure OpenAI,
Anthropic,
or local LLMs,
the interaction pattern is the same.

Now let us understand why wrappers exist.

If you hard-code API calls everywhere,
your code becomes messy and fragile.

Instead,
we create a wrapper layer.

This wrapper exposes
a simple function:
generate(prompt).

Internally,
it handles:
model selection,
parameters,
and API details.

Now let us look at the code.

We define a class called LLMWrapper.

It takes a model name.

It exposes a generate method.

This method accepts:
a prompt,
max tokens,
and temperature.

In this lesson,
we simulate the API call.

Later,
you can replace this logic
with real API requests.

The rest of your application
does not need to change.

This is extremely important.

This abstraction allows you to:
switch models easily,
add logging,
add safety filters,
and add caching.

Every production GenAI system
uses this pattern.

In the next video,
we will build on this wrapper
to execute multiple prompts in sequence.

This is called
multi-prompt chaining.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
