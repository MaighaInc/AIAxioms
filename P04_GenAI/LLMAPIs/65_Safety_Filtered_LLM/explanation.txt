Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

This is the final video
of PART 4 — Generative AI.

Today’s topic is:
SAFETY-FILTERED LLM.

This is one of the most important
lessons in the entire course.

Generative AI is powerful.

But with power comes responsibility.

Modern AI systems must be safe,
ethical,
and controllable.

Now let us understand
why safety filters are required.

LLMs generate text
based on patterns.

They do not understand
morality or legality.

So we must guide them.

Safety filters act as guardrails.

They protect users,
organizations,
and society.

Now let us understand
where safety filters are applied.

There are two stages.

First:
input filtering.

We check the user prompt
before sending it to the model.

If the prompt violates policy,
we block it.

Second:
output filtering.

We check the model’s response
before showing it to the user.

If the output is unsafe,
we block or modify it.

Now let us look at the code.

We define a SafetyFilter class.

This class checks text
for unsafe keywords.

Then we define a simple LLM.

Finally,
we combine them
in a SafetyFilteredLLM.

Every request goes through
the safety filter first.

Only safe requests
reach the model.

Every response is filtered again
before being returned.

This layered defense approach
is used in all production systems.

Companies like OpenAI,
Google,
and Microsoft
use multiple safety layers,
including classifiers
and human review.

Safety is not optional.

It is a core requirement
of responsible AI development.

With this lesson,
we complete PART 4
of the Generative AI journey.

You now understand:
how AI generates text,
images,
code,
how APIs work,
how agents use tools,
and how safety is enforced.

This is a complete,
industry-ready foundation.

Thank you for completing
this journey with me.

You are now prepared
to build,
use,
and deploy Generative AI
responsibly.

See you in the next advanced series.
