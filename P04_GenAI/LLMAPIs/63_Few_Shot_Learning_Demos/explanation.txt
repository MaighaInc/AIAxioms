Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we learned prompt chaining.

Today we learn another
extremely powerful technique.

Today’s topic is:
FEW-SHOT LEARNING.

Few-shot learning allows models
to learn a task
without retraining.

Instead of training data,
we give examples directly
inside the prompt.

Now let us understand the idea.

Language models are pattern matchers.

When we show them examples,
they infer the pattern.

They then apply the same pattern
to new inputs.

This is few-shot learning.

Now let us look at the prompt.

We give the model
two examples.

One positive review.
One negative review.

Then we give a new text
and leave the answer blank.

The model understands the pattern
and completes it.

This feels like learning,
but no weights are updated.

Everything happens
inside the prompt.

Now let us look at the code.

We simulate an LLM
that responds based on
the provided examples.

In real systems,
the model uses probability
and internal representations.

But conceptually,
this is exactly what happens.

Few-shot learning is used in:
classification,
formatting,
extraction,
and reasoning tasks.

It is one of the reasons
LLMs are so powerful.

In the next video,
we will build a tool-using LLM,
where models can call external tools
like calculators and APIs.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
