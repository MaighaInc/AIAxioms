Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we learned few-shot learning.

Today we take a major step forward.

Today’s topic is:
TOOL-USING LLM.

Modern LLMs do more than talk.

They use tools.

They calculate numbers.
They search the web.
They call APIs.
They interact with databases.

This is how LLMs become agents.

Now let us understand the idea.

The LLM first reads the user input.

Then it decides:
can I answer this myself,
or do I need a tool?

If a tool is required,
the LLM calls it.

The tool returns a result.

The LLM then uses that result
to produce a final response.

This is exactly how ChatGPT
uses tools internally.

Now let us look at the code.

We define a calculator tool.

This tool knows how to evaluate
math expressions.

Then we define a ToolUsingLLM class.

If the prompt contains math,
the LLM extracts the expression
and sends it to the calculator.

The calculator returns the result.

The LLM then formats the answer.

This separation is very important.

The LLM decides.
The tool executes.

This pattern is used everywhere in GenAI:
autonomous agents,
assistants,
and workflow automation.

In the next and final video,
we will build a safety-filtered LLM.

This ensures models behave responsibly.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the final video.
