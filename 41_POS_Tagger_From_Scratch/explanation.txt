Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

So far in NLP,
we focused on words and meaning.

Now we move to structure.

Today’s topic is:
POS TAGGER FROM SCRATCH.

POS stands for
Part of Speech.

POS tagging means
assigning grammatical labels
to each word in a sentence.

For example:
noun,
verb,
adjective,
pronoun,
and adverb.

POS tagging is extremely important.

Search engines,
chatbots,
translation systems,
and voice assistants
all rely on POS tags.

Now let us understand the idea.

A word can have
different meanings
depending on how it is used.

For example:
run can be a verb,
or a noun.

POS tagging helps models
understand the role of each word.

Now let us look at the code.

We create a POS tagger
from scratch.

First,
we train the model
using tagged sentences.

For each word,
we count how many times
it appears with each tag.

During prediction,
we use a simple strategy.

If we have seen the word before,
we assign the most frequent tag.

If the word is unknown,
we use fallback rules.

For example:
words ending with ing
are often verbs.

Words ending with ly
are often adverbs.

This combination of
statistics and rules
is very common in NLP.

Now let us test the model.

We give a new sentence.

The tagger assigns
a grammatical role
to each word.

Even with this simple approach,
the model works reasonably well.

Modern POS taggers
use deep learning,
but the core idea is the same.

POS tagging is a foundation
for higher-level NLP tasks
like named entity recognition
and parsing.

In the next video,
we will build a Named Entity
Recognition system.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
