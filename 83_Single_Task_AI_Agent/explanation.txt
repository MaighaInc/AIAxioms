Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

We are now entering
PART 7 — AI AGENTS.

This is where AI stops
just answering questions
and starts doing work.

Today’s topic is:
SINGLE-TASK AI AGENT.

Let us understand what an agent is.

An AI agent has three key components:
perception,
decision,
and action.

It receives a goal,
decides what to do,
and acts.

In this first lesson,
we build the simplest possible agent.

It has one task.

Once completed,
it stops.

Now let us look at the code.

We define a SingleTaskAgent class.

It stores a task.

The agent perceives the task.

Then it acts on it.

Once done,
it marks the task as completed.

This may look simple,
but this structure is the foundation
of all advanced agents.

Every agent,
no matter how complex,
follows this loop.

In the next video,
we will give agents tools.

This allows them to call APIs
and perform real-world actions.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
