Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

This is the FINAL video of the entire course.

Today’s topic is:
AUTONOMOUS AI PLATFORM.

This system represents how real AI
products are built and deployed.

Let us understand the components.

First, we have an agent.
The agent decides what to do.

Second, we have tools.
The agent can calculate when needed.

Third, we have RAG.
Answers are grounded in documents.

Fourth, we have memory.
The system remembers past interactions.

Finally, we expose everything as an API.

This is exactly how modern AI platforms work.

Now let us walk through the flow.

A user sends a prompt.

The agent plans the action.

If calculation is required,
the tool is used.

Otherwise, RAG retrieves facts
and generates a grounded answer.

Memory is updated after every interaction.

The response is returned via API.

This architecture is used in:
AI SaaS products,
enterprise assistants,
copilots,
and autonomous systems.

With this lesson,
you have completed the full AI journey.

From rules,
to machine learning,
to deep learning,
to agents,
to production systems.

You now understand AI
from first principles
to real-world deployment.

Thank you for watching.
Congratulations on completing
THE ENTIRE AI COURSE.
