Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

We are now entering the final part
of this entire AI journey.

This is PART 9 — AUGMENTED & PRODUCTION AI.

Today’s topic is:
HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP AI SYSTEM.

This concept is extremely important.

AI should not always act alone.

In high-stakes domains like:
finance,
healthcare,
law,
and enterprise systems,
human oversight is mandatory.

Now let us understand the idea.

AI generates a recommendation.

A human reviews it.

Only after approval
does the system proceed.

This creates accountability
and prevents catastrophic errors.

Now let us look at the pipeline.

Step one:
AI generates an output.

Step two:
human reviews the output.

Step three:
human approves or rejects.

Step four:
the system acts accordingly.

Now let us look at the code.

The AIModel generates a suggestion.

The HumanReviewer asks for approval.

The HITLSystem orchestrates the flow.

This pattern is used in:
loan approvals,
medical diagnosis,
content moderation,
and legal review systems.

Human-in-the-loop systems balance:
automation and responsibility.

In the next video,
we will build an AI SaaS backend.

This will show how AI is deployed
as a real product.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
