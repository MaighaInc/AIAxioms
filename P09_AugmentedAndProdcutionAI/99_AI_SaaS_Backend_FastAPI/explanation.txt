Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

This is one of the most important videos
in the entire course.

Today’s topic is:
AI SAAS BACKEND USING FASTAPI.

So far,
we built AI models,
agents,
and intelligent systems.

But none of them matter
unless they are deployable.

This is where backend systems come in.

Now let us understand the architecture.

Users do not talk to Python scripts.

They talk to APIs.

An AI SaaS backend exposes AI functionality
through HTTP endpoints.

Now let us look at the components.

FastAPI is the backend framework.

It handles requests and responses.

The AI model is loaded once
and reused across requests.

Each API call invokes the AI model.

Now let us look at the code.

We define a FastAPI app.

We define a simple AI model.

We define request and response schemas.

We expose a /generate endpoint.

This endpoint accepts a prompt
and returns an AI-generated response.

FastAPI automatically creates
documentation for us.

This is available at /docs.

This architecture is used in:
ChatGPT,
AI SaaS startups,
enterprise AI platforms.

From here,
you can add:
authentication,
rate limiting,
logging,
billing,
and monitoring.

In the next and final video
of the entire course,
we will build an autonomous AI platform.

This will combine:
agents,
RAG,
memory,
and production APIs.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the FINAL video.
