Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

So far, we have learned models
that learn using gradients and errors.

Today we are learning something
completely different.

Today’s topic is:
GENETIC ALGORITHM OPTIMIZER.

Genetic algorithms are inspired
by natural evolution.

Instead of asking
how to reduce error,
genetic algorithms ask:
Which solutions survive?

Now let us understand the idea.

In nature,
organisms that are better adapted
survive and reproduce.

Genetic algorithms copy this idea.

Each possible solution
is treated as an individual.

A group of individuals
is called a population.

Each individual is evaluated
using a fitness function.

Better individuals
have higher chances to survive.

Now let us look at the code.

We created a class called GeneticAlgorithm.

Inside the constructor,
we define population size,
number of generations,
and mutation rate.

The fitness function defines
how good a solution is.

In our example,
we want to maximize:
minus x squared plus 10.

The best value of x
is close to zero.

Now the algorithm starts
by creating a random population.

Then for each generation,
we select the best individuals.

These are the parents.

We then create new individuals
using crossover and mutation.

In this simplified example,
crossover just copies the parent.

Mutation introduces randomness
by slightly changing the value.

This randomness is very important.

Without mutation,
the algorithm would get stuck.

You will notice that
as generations increase,
the fitness improves.

This means the population is evolving.

Genetic algorithms are powerful
because they do not require gradients.

They work even when:
the function is not differentiable,
the search space is discrete,
or the problem is very complex.

However,
genetic algorithms can be slow.

They are best used
when other optimization methods fail.

In the next video,
we will learn A-star pathfinding,
which is a search-based AI algorithm.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
