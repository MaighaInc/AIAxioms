Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we built short-term conversational memory.

That memory disappears
when the conversation ends.

Today we solve that problem.

Today’s topic is:
LONG-TERM VECTOR MEMORY.

Long-term memory allows AI
to remember information
across sessions and time.

Now let us understand the key idea.

We cannot store everything
in short-term memory.

Instead,
we store important information
as memories.

These memories are stored
as vector embeddings.

When a new query arrives,
we retrieve the most relevant memories
using vector similarity.

Now let us look at the code.

We store memories as text.

When retrieving,
we convert both the query
and memories into vectors.

We then compute cosine similarity.

The memories with the highest similarity
are retrieved.

This is exactly how
modern agent memory systems work.

Long-term memory is used for:
user preferences,
facts learned over time,
past interactions,
and personalization.

This memory persists
even when the session ends.

In the next video,
we will build
EPISODIC MEMORY,
which stores events
instead of raw facts.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
