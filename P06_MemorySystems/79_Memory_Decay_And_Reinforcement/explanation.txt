Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we built episodic memory.

Now we solve a critical problem.

Memory cannot grow forever.

Today’s topic is:
MEMORY DECAY AND REINFORCEMENT.

Human memory works this way.

Things we don’t use,
we forget.

Things we use often,
we remember strongly.

AI memory should behave the same.

Now let us understand the concepts.

Each memory has a strength.

Over time,
this strength decays.

If the memory is accessed again,
its strength increases.

This is reinforcement.

Now let us look at the code.

Each memory item tracks:
content,
strength,
and last accessed time.

We decay memory strength
based on time passed.

When a memory is accessed,
we reinforce it.

Finally,
we clean up memories
below a strength threshold.

This prevents memory overload.

This approach is used in:
long-running agents,
personal assistants,
and recommendation systems.

Without decay,
memory becomes noisy.

Without reinforcement,
important information is lost.

In the next video,
we will use memory
to personalize AI behavior
for individual users.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
