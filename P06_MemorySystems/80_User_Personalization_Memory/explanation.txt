Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we built memory decay and reinforcement.

Now we use memory
to personalize AI behavior.

Today’s topic is:
USER PERSONALIZATION MEMORY.

Personalization is what makes AI
feel helpful instead of generic.

Let us understand the idea.

Different users have
different preferences.

Some want Python examples.
Some prefer short explanations.
Some like detailed theory.

The AI should adapt.

Now let us look at the approach.

We maintain a user profile.

This profile stores preferences.

Each time the user interacts,
we update the profile.

Over time,
the assistant learns what the user likes.

Now let us look at the code.

We define a UserProfile class.

It stores preferences as key-value pairs.

We then define a PersonalizedAssistant.

This assistant detects signals
in user messages.

If the user mentions Python,
we store that preference.

If the user asks for short responses,
we store that too.

Future responses are generated
using these preferences.

This approach is used in:
personal assistants,
recommendation systems,
and adaptive learning platforms.

In the next video,
we will persist memory
across sessions.

This allows AI to remember users
even after restart.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
