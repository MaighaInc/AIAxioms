Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we built a code-writing agent.

But writing code is only half the job.

Real developers spend most of their time
debugging.

Today’s topic is:
DEBUGGING AI AGENT.

This agent reads code,
understands errors,
and suggests fixes.

Now let us understand the pipeline.

First,
the agent receives code.

Second,
it analyzes the code.

Third,
it identifies potential errors.

Fourth,
it suggests fixes.

Now let us look at the code.

The analyze method scans the code
for common mistakes.

The suggest_fix method
explains how to fix them.

This approach can be extended to:
stack traces,
unit test failures,
and runtime logs.

This is how AI debugging assistants work.

They don’t just say “error”.
They explain why
and how to fix it.

In the next and final video
of PART 7,
we will build a multi-step task executor.

This agent will chain actions together
to complete complex goals.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the final video.
