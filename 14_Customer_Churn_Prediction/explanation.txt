Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we discussed credit risk scoring,
which is used in banking.

Today we are moving to another
very important business application.

Today’s topic is:
CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION.

Customer churn means
a customer leaving a service.

For subscription-based companies,
churn directly affects revenue.

Acquiring a new customer
is much more expensive
than retaining an existing one.

That is why churn prediction
is extremely valuable.

Now let us understand the data.

We use the following features:
how long the customer stayed,
monthly charges,
total charges,
number of support calls,
and contract type.

The output is simple:
1 means the customer churned.
0 means the customer stayed.

Now let us look at the code.

First,
we prepare the dataset using numpy.

Then we split the data
into training and testing sets.

Next,
we train a logistic regression model.

Logistic regression is preferred here
because it gives probabilities.

After training,
we make predictions
on the test data.

We evaluate the model using:
accuracy,
confusion matrix,
and classification report.

Now let us focus on probabilities.

A churn probability of 0.8
means the customer is very likely to leave.

Businesses can use this information
to offer discounts,
improve service,
or intervene early.

Finally,
we test the model
with a new customer.

The model outputs
both probability and decision.

Customer churn prediction
is widely used in:
telecom companies,
streaming platforms,
SaaS products,
and banks.

In the next video,
we will use a famous dataset
to learn multi-class classification
using the Iris dataset.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
