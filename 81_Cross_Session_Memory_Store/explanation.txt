Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we built user personalization memory.

Now we solve another major limitation.

What happens when the system restarts?

Without persistence,
all memory is lost.

Today’s topic is:
CROSS-SESSION MEMORY STORE.

Cross-session memory allows AI
to remember users
even after shutdown.

Now let us understand the idea.

Instead of storing memory only in RAM,
we store it on disk.

This can be a file,
a database,
or cloud storage.

When the system starts,
it loads the memory back.

Now let us look at the code.

We use a simple JSON file
to store memory.

When the program starts,
we load existing memory.

When we update memory,
we save it immediately.

This guarantees persistence.

This approach is used in:
chatbots,
assistants,
and personalization systems.

In production,
this file storage is replaced
by databases like:
PostgreSQL,
Redis,
or vector databases.

But the idea remains the same.

In the next and final video
of PART 6,
we will visualize memory.

This helps developers understand
what the AI remembers.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
