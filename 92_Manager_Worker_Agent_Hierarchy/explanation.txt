Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we built a collaborative agent team.

Now we add structure.

Today’s topic is:
MANAGER–WORKER AGENT HIERARCHY.

In real organizations,
not everyone does everything.

Some people plan.
Some execute.

AI systems follow the same idea.

Now let us understand the roles.

The ManagerAgent:
receives the goal,
plans tasks,
assigns work.

The WorkerAgents:
execute assigned tasks.

This separation allows:
scalability,
parallelism,
and control.

Now let us look at the code.

The manager breaks a goal
into tasks.

Each task is assigned
to a worker.

Workers return results.

The manager tracks completion.

This pattern is used in:
AutoGPT,
CrewAI,
LangGraph,
enterprise workflows.

In the next video,
we will explore debate-based agents.

Agents will argue
to reach better decisions.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
