Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

This is the final video
of PART 8 — AGENTIC AI SYSTEMS.

Today’s topic is:
AGENT EVALUATION FRAMEWORK.

Building AI agents is exciting.

But deploying them without evaluation
is dangerous.

Evaluation answers the question:
Can we trust this agent?

Now let us understand
what we evaluate.

First is accuracy.
Did the agent produce the correct answer?

Second is reasoning.
Did the agent explain itself clearly?

Third is safety.
Did the agent avoid harmful outputs?

Now let us look at the framework.

Each metric is scored individually.

Then we compute a final score.

This allows us to:
compare agents,
track improvements,
and detect regressions.

Now let us look at the code.

We define evaluation functions
for accuracy, reasoning, and safety.

Each function assigns a score.

The final score is an average.

In real systems,
these metrics are far more advanced.

They include:
human evaluation,
automated benchmarks,
adversarial testing,
and monitoring.

But the foundation is the same.

Without evaluation,
AI systems are not production-ready.

With this lesson,
you have completed PART 8.

You now understand:
multi-agent systems,
hierarchies,
debate,
reflection,
auto-improvement,
memory integration,
and evaluation.

This completes the FULL AI JOURNEY
from rules to autonomous agents.

Thank you for watching.
Congratulations on completing
PART 8 — AGENTIC AI SYSTEMS.
