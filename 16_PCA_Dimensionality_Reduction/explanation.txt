Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous set of videos,
we focused on supervised learning,
where models learn using labeled data.

Today we are moving to a new concept.

Today’s topic is:
PCA – PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS.

PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique.

Before we understand PCA,
let us understand the problem.

Real-world datasets often have
many features.

Too many features cause problems like:
slow training,
overfitting,
high memory usage,
and difficulty in visualization.

PCA solves this problem
by reducing the number of features
without losing much information.

Now here is the most important idea.

PCA does NOT select features.
It creates new features.

These new features are called
principal components.

Each principal component
is a combination of original features.

Now let us look at the dataset.

We use the Iris dataset,
which has four features.

We want to reduce these
four features into two.

Before applying PCA,
we must standardize the data.

This is very important.

If features are not standardized,
PCA will give incorrect results.

That is why we use StandardScaler.

Now let us apply PCA.

We tell PCA to create
two principal components.

The output is a dataset
with only two columns.

This means we reduced the dimension
from four to two.

Now let us talk about explained variance.

Explained variance tells us
how much information
each principal component contains.

In our example,
the first two components together
retain more than 95 percent
of the original information.

This means very little information
was lost during compression.

Now let us look at PCA components.

Each component shows
how much each original feature
contributes to that component.

This helps us understand
which features are most important.

Now when should you use PCA?

You should use PCA when:
you have many numerical features,
features are correlated,
you want faster training,
or you want to visualize data.

When should you avoid PCA?

Avoid PCA when:
feature interpretability is critical,
or features already have clear meaning.

PCA is commonly used
before classification,
clustering,
and visualization.

In the next video,
we will move to K-Means clustering,
which is an unsupervised learning algorithm.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
