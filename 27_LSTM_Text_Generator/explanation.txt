Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we learned how RNNs work with sequences.

But we also learned their limitation:
they struggle with long-term memory.

Today’s topic solves that problem.

Today we are learning:
LSTM TEXT GENERATOR.

LSTM stands for
Long Short-Term Memory.

It is a special type of RNN
designed to remember information
for a long time.

This is why LSTMs are used in:
language models,
chatbots,
speech recognition,
and text generation.

Now let us understand the problem.

We want the model
to generate text.

This means the model must:
understand characters,
learn patterns,
and predict what comes next.

We use character-level text generation
because it is easier to understand.

Each character is treated
as a prediction task.

Now let us look at the code.

First,
we define a small training text.

We extract all unique characters
and create a vocabulary.

Each character is converted
into a numerical index.

Now we prepare training sequences.

For example:
input might be "deep learn"
and output might be the next character.

We convert inputs and outputs
into one-hot encoded vectors.

Now let us build the model.

We use an LSTM layer
with 128 memory units.

This layer processes characters
one by one
and maintains internal memory.

Then we use a Dense layer
with softmax activation.

Softmax outputs probabilities
for every possible character.

We train the model
using categorical cross-entropy loss.

After training,
we move to text generation.

We start with a seed text.

Then we repeatedly:
predict the next character,
append it to the text,
and feed it back to the model.

This creates new text
character by character.

The generated text
may not be perfect,
but it follows learned patterns.

This is exactly how
early language models worked.

LSTM text generation
was a major breakthrough
before transformers existed.

In the next video,
we will learn about GRU,
which is a simpler and faster
alternative to LSTM.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
