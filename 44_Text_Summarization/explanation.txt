Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we built a sentiment analysis system.

Today we move to another
very practical NLP task.

Today’s topic is:
TEXT SUMMARIZATION.

Text summarization means
shortening a long document
while keeping the important information.

This is used in:
news apps,
search engines,
document analysis,
and research tools.

There are two types of summarization.

Extractive summarization.
Abstractive summarization.

Today we focus on
extractive summarization.

Extractive summarization means
selecting the most important sentences
from the original text.

Now let us understand the idea.

Important sentences usually contain
important words.

If a word appears many times
in a document,
it is likely important.

We use this idea
to score sentences.

Now let us look at the code.

First,
we split the text into sentences.

Then we split sentences into words.

Next,
we calculate word frequencies
for the entire document.

Then we score each sentence.

A sentence score
is the sum of frequencies
of the words it contains.

Sentences with higher scores
are considered more important.

Finally,
we select the top sentences
as the summary.

Now let us test the summarizer.

We give a paragraph as input.

The system extracts
the most important sentences
and creates a summary.

This approach is simple,
fast,
and surprisingly effective.

However,
it does not rewrite sentences.

It only selects them.

Modern systems use
abstractive summarization
with transformers.

But even those models
use importance scoring internally.

In the next video,
we will build a
question answering system,
where machines answer questions
from text.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
