Long-Term Vector Memory
======================

This project demonstrates how
AI systems store and retrieve
long-term memories using vectors.

Requirements:
------------
- Python 3.x

How to Run:
-----------
1. Open terminal
2. Navigate to this folder
3. Run:

   python long_term_vector_memory.py

Expected Output:
----------------
- Relevant past memories retrieved
  based on similarity

Learning Objective:
-------------------
Understand how persistent AI memory
is implemented using embeddings.
