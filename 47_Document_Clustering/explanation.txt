Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we learned how to measure text similarity.

Now we take the next step.

Today’s topic is:
DOCUMENT CLUSTERING.

Document clustering means
grouping documents automatically
without labels.

This is used in:
news grouping,
search engines,
topic discovery,
and recommendation systems.

Now let us understand the idea.

Documents that talk about
similar topics
should be grouped together.

Documents with different topics
should be placed in different groups.

Now let us look at the approach.

First,
we convert documents into vectors
using word frequency.

Next,
we use a clustering algorithm
similar to K-means.

We randomly choose cluster centers.

Then,
we assign each document
to the nearest cluster
based on cosine similarity.

After assignment,
we update cluster centers
by averaging vectors.

This process repeats
until clusters stabilize.

Now let us look at the code.

We build a vocabulary
from all documents.

Each document is converted
into a numeric vector.

We initialize centroids randomly.

Then we repeat:
assignment and update steps.

Finally,
documents are grouped
into meaningful clusters.

Now let us look at the result.

Documents about machine learning
are grouped together.

Documents about sports
are grouped together.

This shows how clustering
discovers structure
without supervision.

Modern NLP systems
use embeddings and transformers
for clustering.

But the core idea
remains exactly the same.

In the next video,
we will learn topic modeling,
which finds hidden themes
inside documents.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
