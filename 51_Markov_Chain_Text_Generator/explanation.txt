Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

We are officially starting
PART 4 — GENERATIVE AI.

This part explains how machines
create new content.

Before neural networks,
before transformers,
text generation already existed.

Today’s topic is:
MARKOV CHAIN TEXT GENERATOR.

This is one of the earliest
text generation techniques.

Now let us understand the idea.

A Markov Chain assumes one simple rule:
the next word depends only
on the current word.

It does not look at the entire sentence.
It only looks one step ahead.

This may sound simple,
but it is very powerful.

Now let us look at the code.

We train the model
using sample text.

The model learns word transitions.

For example:
if the word is artificial,
the next word is often intelligence.

During generation,
we start with a word.

Then we randomly choose
the next word
based on learned transitions.

This process repeats.

The result is new text
that looks similar
to the training data.

This is true text generation.

It is not copying sentences.
It is generating new sequences.

Markov models were used
in early chatbots,
games,
and creative writing tools.

They have limitations.

They cannot understand long context.
They often produce nonsense.

To fix this,
we move to neural networks.

In the next video,
we will build a
character-level language model,
which learns sequences using neural networks.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
