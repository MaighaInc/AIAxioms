Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

Now we are officially entering
real-world machine learning.

So far, we implemented everything from scratch.
That helped us understand how AI works internally.

But in real projects,
we use powerful libraries.

Today’s topic is:
HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION USING SCIKIT-LEARN.

This is one of the most common
machine learning regression problems.

The goal is simple:
Predict the price of a house
based on its features.

In our example,
we use three features:
house size in square feet,
number of bedrooms,
and age of the house.

The output is the house price
in thousands.

Now let us look at the workflow.

Step one is preparing the dataset.
We store features in X
and prices in y.

Step two is splitting the data.
We divide data into training and testing sets.
This helps us evaluate the model honestly.

Step three is training the model.
We use Linear Regression from scikit-learn.
The library automatically learns
the best coefficients.

Step four is prediction.
We use the trained model
to predict prices on unseen data.

Step five is evaluation.

We calculate RMSE,
which tells us how much error
the model makes on average.

We also calculate R2 score,
which tells us how well the model fits the data.

Now let us talk about feature coefficients.

Each coefficient tells us
how much that feature affects price.

For example:
If size coefficient is high,
it means larger houses cost more.

Finally,
we test the model
by predicting the price
of a new house.

This entire pipeline
is exactly how real ML systems work.

House price prediction is widely used
in real estate platforms,
bank loan approvals,
and property analytics.

In the next video,
we will move to text classification
and build a spam email classifier.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
