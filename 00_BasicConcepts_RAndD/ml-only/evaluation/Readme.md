Technique: Cross-Validation

Goal:
Estimate generalization performance.

How it works:
- Split data into k folds
- Train on k-1 folds
- Test on remaining fold

Benefits:
- Reduces overfitting risk
- Reliable performance estimate

*****************************************
Technique: Grid Search

Goal:
Hyperparameter optimization.

How it works:
- Define parameter grid
- Train model for all combinations
- Select best-performing parameters

Tradeoff:
Accuracy vs computation time
