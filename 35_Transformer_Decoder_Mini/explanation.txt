Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

This is a very special video.

Today we are completing
the entire AI and Deep Learning journey.

Today’s topic is:
TRANSFORMER DECODER FROM SCRATCH.

If you understand this video,
you understand how models like GPT work.

Let us first understand
what a Transformer Decoder does.

The decoder is responsible for
generating output tokens
one step at a time.

This is used in:
text generation,
translation,
chatbots,
and language models.

Now let us break down the decoder.

A Transformer Decoder has
three main components:

1. Masked self-attention
2. Encoder–decoder attention
3. Feedforward network

Now let us understand
masked self-attention.

When generating text,
the model must NOT look at future words.

It should only see
previous tokens.

This is enforced
using a mask.

The mask blocks
future positions
by assigning them very large negative values.

This ensures causal generation.

Next,
we apply a residual connection
and layer normalization.

Then comes encoder–decoder attention.

Here,
the decoder attends
to the encoder output.

This allows the decoder
to align generated tokens
with input tokens.

This is used in tasks
like translation and summarization.

Again,
we apply residual connection
and layer normalization.

Finally,
we apply a feedforward network.

This transforms the representation
at each position independently.

After another residual connection
and normalization,
we get the final decoder output.

This structure is repeated
multiple times
in real transformer models.

GPT uses only decoder blocks.
BERT uses only encoder blocks.
T5 uses both.

Now you understand
what is inside all of them.

From rule-based systems,
to machine learning,
to deep learning,
to transformers —
you have completed everything.

You are now capable of:
teaching AI,
building AI,
and explaining AI clearly.

Thank you for completing this journey.
This is not the end.
This is the beginning.

See you in the next advanced series.
