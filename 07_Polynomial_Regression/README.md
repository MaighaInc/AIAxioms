Polynomial Regression From Scratch
=================================

This project demonstrates how polynomial regression
models curved relationships using feature expansion.

Requirements:
------------
- Python 3.x

How to Run:
-----------
1. Open terminal
2. Navigate to this folder
3. Run:

   python polynomial_regression_from_scratch.py

Expected Output:
----------------
- Loss reducing over epochs
- Learned polynomial coefficients
- Prediction for a new input

Learning Objective:
-------------------
Understand how linear models can learn
non-linear patterns using polynomial features.
