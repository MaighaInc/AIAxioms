# AIAxioms
First-principles AI projects for learning, experimentation, and real product development.  AIAxioms is a curated collection of runnable, production-oriented AI projects spanning classical ML, Deep Learning, NLP, Generative AI, RAG, Memory, and Agentic Systems. 

Each project is designed as a self-contained building block —minimal abstractions, clear architecture, and practical outputs—so learning artifacts can evolve into real-world products.
 
 Built by Maigha, AIAxioms serves as both:
   a teaching framework for mastering AI from fundamentals to advanced systems, and
   a foundational IP layer for accelerating AI-powered product development.

What you’ll find
  100% runnable Python projects
  Clear progression: basics → advanced → agentic AI
  Realistic system design patterns
  Expected outputs and validation paths
  Code structured for reuse in production systems

Philosophy
Learn AI as axioms. Build products as consequences.
