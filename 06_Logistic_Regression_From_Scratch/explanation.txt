Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we learned about linear regression,
which predicts continuous values.

Today we are learning something slightly different,
but extremely important.

Today’s topic is:
LOGISTIC REGRESSION FROM SCRATCH.

Logistic regression is used
when the output is not a number,
but a category.

For example:
Pass or Fail,
Yes or No,
Spam or Not Spam.

Now let us understand
why we cannot use linear regression
for classification.

Linear regression can predict
any value from minus infinity to plus infinity.

But probabilities must be between 0 and 1.

So logistic regression solves this problem
using a function called the sigmoid function.

The sigmoid function takes any number
and converts it into a value between 0 and 1.

This value represents probability.

Now let us look at the formula.

First, we calculate:
z equals w times x plus b.

Then we apply the sigmoid function:
probability equals sigmoid of z.

If the probability is greater than or equal to 0.5,
we predict class 1.
Otherwise, class 0.

Now let us look at the code.

We created a class called LogisticRegression.

Inside the constructor,
we define learning rate and number of epochs.

The sigmoid function converts numbers
into probabilities.

The predict_probability function
returns the probability of class 1.

The predict function converts probability
into a class label.

The train function is where learning happens.

For each data point,
we calculate the predicted probability.

Then we calculate loss
using log loss,
also called binary cross entropy.

This loss punishes confident wrong predictions
more than small mistakes.

Then we calculate gradients
and update the weight and bias.

You will notice that
the loss keeps decreasing.

This means the model is learning.

After training,
we print the learned parameters.

Then we test the model
with a new value.

The output shows
both probability and predicted class.

This is very important in real applications.

For example,
in medical diagnosis,
probability matters more than just yes or no.

Logistic regression is widely used in:
credit scoring,
medical diagnosis,
churn prediction,
and spam detection.

If you understand logistic regression deeply,
you understand the foundation
of classification in machine learning.

In the next video,
we will move to polynomial regression,
where linear models learn curves.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
