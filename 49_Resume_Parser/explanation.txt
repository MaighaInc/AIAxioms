Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

This is a very important video.

Today we are building
a real-world NLP system.

Today’s topic is:
RESUME PARSER.

Resume parsers are used
by almost every company.

They are part of
Applicant Tracking Systems,
also called ATS.

Now let us understand the problem.

Resumes come in many formats.

They are unstructured text.

But recruiters need
structured information like:
name,
email,
phone number,
and skills.

NLP helps us convert
unstructured text
into structured data.

Now let us look at the approach.

We use multiple NLP techniques.

First,
we extract the name.

This is usually the first line
of the resume.

Next,
we extract email addresses
using regular expressions.

Then we extract phone numbers.

After that,
we extract skills.

We maintain a predefined skill list
and search for these keywords.

This approach works surprisingly well
for many resumes.

Now let us look at the code.

We define a ResumeParser class.

Each method extracts
one type of information.

Finally,
we combine everything
into a structured dictionary.

Now let us test the parser.

We give a sample resume.

The system extracts
all important details correctly.

In real systems,
resume parsers use
machine learning
and deep learning.

But even advanced systems
start with this logic.

This project combines
everything you learned so far:
tokenization,
NER,
pattern matching,
and keyword extraction.

In the next and final video,
we will build a chatbot
that combines rules and machine learning.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the final video.
