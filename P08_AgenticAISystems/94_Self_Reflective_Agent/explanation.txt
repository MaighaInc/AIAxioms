Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we built debate-based reasoning agents.

Now we move inward.

Today’s topic is:
SELF-REFLECTIVE AI AGENT.

This agent does something powerful.

It critiques itself.

Humans improve by reflection.
AI can do the same.

Now let us understand the loop.

Step one:
the agent generates an answer.

Step two:
the agent reviews the answer.

Step three:
it identifies weaknesses.

Step four:
it improves the answer.

This loop can repeat multiple times.

Now let us look at the code.

The generate method
creates an initial response.

The reflect method
critiques the response.

The improve method
enhances the answer.

This architecture is used in:
alignment research,
safe AI systems,
and autonomous improvement loops.

Self-reflection reduces hallucinations
and increases reliability.

In the next video,
we will build an auto-improving agent.

This agent learns continuously
from its past outputs.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
