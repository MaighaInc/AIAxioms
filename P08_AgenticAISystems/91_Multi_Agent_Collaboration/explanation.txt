Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

We are now starting
PART 8 — AGENTIC AI SYSTEMS.

This is the highest level
of AI architecture.

Today’s topic is:
MULTI-AGENT COLLABORATION.

Single agents are powerful.

But real-world problems
are solved by teams.

AI systems work the same way.

Multiple agents specialize
and collaborate.

Now let us understand the roles.

We have a ResearchAgent.

Its job is to gather information.

We have a WritingAgent.

Its job is to produce output.

We have a CoordinatorAgent.

Its job is to orchestrate the workflow.

Now let us look at the code.

The coordinator assigns tasks.

Each agent works independently.

Results are passed between agents.

This architecture is used in:
AutoGPT,
CrewAI,
LangGraph,
and enterprise AI systems.

Multi-agent systems allow:
parallel work,
specialization,
and scalability.

In the next video,
we will introduce hierarchy.

Some agents will manage others.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
