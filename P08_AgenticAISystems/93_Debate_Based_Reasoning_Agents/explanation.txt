Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we built a manager–worker hierarchy.

Now we move to reasoning quality.

Today’s topic is:
DEBATE-BASED REASONING AGENTS.

One agent reasoning alone
can make mistakes.

But when multiple agents
argue opposing views,
errors are reduced.

This is similar to
peer review in research.

Now let us understand the architecture.

We have:
a ProAgent,
a ConAgent,
and a JudgeAgent.

The ProAgent supports the idea.
The ConAgent challenges it.
The JudgeAgent evaluates both.

This leads to more balanced conclusions.

Now let us look at the code.

Each agent produces an argument.

The judge inspects both sides
and makes a decision.

This pattern is used in:
AI alignment,
safety research,
decision systems,
and evaluation frameworks.

Debate-based reasoning
reduces hallucinations
and overconfidence.

In the next video,
we will build a self-reflective agent.

This agent will critique its own answers.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
