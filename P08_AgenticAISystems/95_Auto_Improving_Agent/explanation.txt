Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we built a self-reflective agent.

Now we go one step further.

Today’s topic is:
AUTO-IMPROVING AI AGENT.

Reflection improves one response.

Auto-improvement improves future behavior.

Now let us understand the idea.

The agent performs a task.

It evaluates its output.

It receives feedback.

It updates internal behavior.

Over time,
the agent becomes better.

Now let us look at the code.

The agent tracks an improvement level.

After each run,
feedback is evaluated.

If feedback indicates weakness,
the agent updates itself.

Next time,
the agent produces a better response.

This approach is used in:
long-running agents,
autonomous systems,
and reinforcement learning setups.

Auto-improvement is powerful,
but must be controlled carefully.

Uncontrolled learning
can lead to drift.

In the next video,
we will integrate memory and tools
into a single agent.

This creates a fully capable
intelligent agent.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
