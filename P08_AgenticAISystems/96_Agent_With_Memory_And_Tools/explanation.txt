Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

This is a very important lesson.

Today’s topic is:
AGENT WITH MEMORY AND TOOLS.

So far,
we learned memory systems,
tool-using agents,
and reasoning loops.

Now we combine them.

This is how real assistants work.

Let us understand the architecture.

The agent has memory.

It stores important interactions.

The agent also has tools.

It decides when to use them.

Now let us look at the flow.

A user sends a task.

The agent thinks:
do I need a tool?

If yes,
it calls the tool.

If not,
it responds using memory.

Now let us look at the code.

We define a memory class.

We define a calculator tool.

The agent decides actions
based on the task.

It stores results in memory.

Future responses
can reference past interactions.

This architecture is used in:
ChatGPT,
Copilots,
enterprise assistants,
and autonomous agents.

In the next and final video
of PART 8,
we will evaluate agents.

Evaluation is critical
for safety, performance,
and reliability.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the final video.
