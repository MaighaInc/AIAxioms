Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

Today we are finishing our classical AI section
with one of the most important algorithms ever created.

Today’s topic is:
A STAR PATHFINDING ALGORITHM.

A star, written as A star,
is used to find the shortest path
between two points.

It is widely used in:
video games,
robot navigation,
GPS systems,
and map applications.

Now let us understand the problem.

Imagine a robot inside a grid.
Some cells are blocked.
Some cells are free.

The robot has a starting point
and a destination.

The goal is to reach the destination
using the shortest possible path
without hitting obstacles.

A star solves this problem
using two ideas:
cost so far
and estimated cost to the goal.

The formula used is:
f equals g plus h.

Here,
g is the cost from the start to the current node.
h is the heuristic estimate
from the current node to the goal.

The heuristic is a guess,
but a smart one.

In our example,
we use Manhattan distance,
which works well for grid movement.

Now let us look at the code.

We created a class called AStar.

The constructor takes:
the grid,
the start position,
and the goal position.

The heuristic function calculates
the Manhattan distance.

The get_neighbors function
returns all valid neighboring cells
that are not blocked.

The find_path function
implements the A star algorithm.

We use a priority queue
to always expand the node
with the lowest estimated cost.

We store where each node came from
so that we can reconstruct the path later.

When the goal is reached,
we reconstruct the path
by moving backward from the goal
to the start.

The final output
is the optimal path.

A star is guaranteed to find
the shortest path
as long as the heuristic is admissible.

That means the heuristic
never overestimates the distance.

Now let us talk about why A star is important.

Unlike brute-force search,
A star is efficient.

It does not explore unnecessary paths.

It combines intelligence
with optimality.

This algorithm represents
true decision-making AI.

With this,
we have completed the core classical AI section.

In the next set of videos,
we will move to machine learning using libraries
and real-world datasets.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
