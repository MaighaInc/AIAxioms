A* Pathfinding Algorithm
=======================

This project demonstrates how A* search
finds the shortest path using heuristics.

Requirements:
------------
- Python 3.x

How to Run:
-----------
1. Open terminal
2. Navigate to this folder
3. Run:

   python astar_pathfinding_from_scratch.py

Expected Output:
----------------
- Optimal path from start to goal

Learning Objective:
-------------------
Understand how heuristic-based search
combines cost and estimation to find
optimal paths.
