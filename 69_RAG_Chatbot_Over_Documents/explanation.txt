Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

This is a very important video.

Today we are building
a RAG CHATBOT OVER DOCUMENTS.

This is what people mean when they say:
ChatGPT over PDFs.

Now let us understand the problem.

LLMs are powerful,
but they do not know your documents.

They cannot access PDFs,
internal files,
or company data.

RAG solves this problem.

RAG stands for
Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

It means:
retrieve relevant information,
then generate an answer using it.

Now let us understand the pipeline.

Step one:
the user asks a question.

Step two:
we convert the question into a vector.

Step three:
we search document chunks
using vector similarity.

Step four:
we retrieve the most relevant chunks.

Step five:
we pass these chunks
to the language model
to generate an answer.

Now let us look at the code.

We simulate embeddings
using word frequency vectors.

We compute cosine similarity
between the question and document chunks.

We retrieve the top matching chunks.

Then we combine them
to form the context.

Finally,
we generate an answer
based on the retrieved context.

This separation is critical.

The LLM does not guess.
It answers using retrieved facts.

This is why RAG reduces hallucinations.

This architecture is used in:
enterprise chatbots,
research assistants,
legal search,
and customer support bots.

In the next video,
we will extend this idea
to answer questions
across multiple documents.

That is called
Multi-Document QA.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
