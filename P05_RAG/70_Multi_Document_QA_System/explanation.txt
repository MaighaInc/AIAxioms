Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we built a RAG chatbot over one set of documents.

Today we take the next step.

Today’s topic is:
MULTI-DOCUMENT QA SYSTEM.

Real-world systems
do not work with a single file.

They work with:
folders,
knowledge bases,
and entire repositories.

Now let us understand the challenge.

A question may be answered
by information spread
across many documents.

So we must search everywhere.

Now let us understand the pipeline.

Step one:
we store documents separately.

Each document is split into chunks.

Step two:
when a question arrives,
we convert it into a vector.

Step three:
we compare the question
against all chunks
from all documents.

Step four:
we rank results globally.

Step five:
we retrieve the top chunks,
even if they come from
different documents.

Step six:
we generate an answer
using the combined context.

Now let us look at the code.

We store documents
in a dictionary.

Each document has its own chunks.

We build a global vocabulary.

Then we compute similarity
between the question
and every chunk.

We keep the top matches,
regardless of source.

Finally,
we generate an answer
that references
multiple documents.

This is how enterprise QA works.

This system can answer:
policy questions,
technical questions,
and research queries.

In the next video,
we will improve retrieval quality
by combining keyword search
and vector search.

That is called Hybrid Search.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
