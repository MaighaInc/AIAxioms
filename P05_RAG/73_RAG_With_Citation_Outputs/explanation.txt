Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we built metadata-aware retrieval.

Today we focus on trust.

Today’s topic is:
RAG WITH CITATION OUTPUTS.

One of the biggest problems
with generative AI
is hallucination.

Models can sound confident
even when they are wrong.

Citations solve this.

Citations show
where the answer came from.

They allow users
to verify information.

Now let us understand the pipeline.

Step one:
retrieve relevant documents.

Step two:
select the most relevant chunks.

Step three:
generate an answer
based only on retrieved text.

Step four:
attach citations
that point to original sources.

This makes answers auditable.

Now let us look at the code.

Each document includes
a source field.

During retrieval,
we rank documents by similarity.

We then combine the top chunks
into the answer.

At the same time,
we track which source
each chunk came from.

Finally,
we return the answer
along with citations.

This approach is used in:
research assistants,
legal tools,
medical AI,
and enterprise knowledge systems.

Citations build trust.

Without citations,
RAG systems are incomplete.

In the next video,
we will improve user experience
by streaming RAG responses.

That makes chatbots feel
real-time and interactive.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
