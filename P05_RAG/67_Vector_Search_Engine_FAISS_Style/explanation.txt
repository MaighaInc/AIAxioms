Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we learned how to convert text
into vector embeddings.

Today we answer the next question.

Once text is converted into vectors,
how do we search it?

Today’s topic is:
VECTOR SEARCH ENGINE.

This is the heart of RAG systems.

Vector search allows us
to find documents
based on meaning,
not keyword matching.

Now let us understand the idea.

Each document is a vector.

The query is also converted
into a vector.

We then compare the query vector
with every document vector.

The documents with the highest similarity
are the most relevant.

This is semantic search.

Now let us look at the code.

We reuse the embedding logic
from the previous lesson.

Then we calculate cosine similarity.

Cosine similarity measures
the angle between two vectors.

If the angle is small,
the meaning is similar.

We compute similarity
between the query
and every document.

Then we sort the results
and return the top matches.

This is exactly what FAISS does,
but at massive scale.

FAISS uses optimized math
and indexing
to perform this search
over millions of vectors.

But conceptually,
the logic is identical.

Vector search is used in:
RAG chatbots,
recommendation systems,
document retrieval,
and enterprise knowledge search.

In the next video,
we will ingest real documents
by building a PDF ingestion pipeline.

That is where RAG becomes real.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
