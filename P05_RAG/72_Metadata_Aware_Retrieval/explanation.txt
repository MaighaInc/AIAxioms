Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we built a hybrid search engine.

Today we make retrieval
enterprise-ready.

Today’s topic is:
METADATA-AWARE RETRIEVAL.

In real organizations,
not all documents are equal.

Some belong to HR.
Some to finance.
Some are confidential.

RAG systems must respect this.

Metadata is information
about the document,
not inside the document.

Examples include:
department,
author,
date,
access level.

Now let us understand why
metadata matters.

Without metadata filtering,
a user may see documents
they should not access.

Or irrelevant documents
may pollute retrieval.

Metadata filtering ensures:
security,
relevance,
and precision.

Now let us look at the pipeline.

First,
we receive a user query.

Second,
we apply metadata filters.

This removes documents
that do not match context.

Only then
do we perform vector search.

This improves both
performance and accuracy.

Now let us look at the code.

Each document has:
text and metadata.

We first filter documents
based on metadata conditions.

Then we build embeddings
only for allowed documents.

Finally,
we compute similarity
and return results.

This architecture is used in:
enterprise search,
internal assistants,
and regulated industries.

In the next video,
we will enhance RAG outputs
by adding citations.

This builds trust and transparency.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
