Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we built a multi-document QA system.

Today we improve retrieval quality.

Today’s topic is:
HYBRID SEARCH.

Hybrid search combines
keyword-based search
and vector-based semantic search.

Now let us understand why this matters.

Keyword search is very precise.

If a document contains
the exact words,
it scores high.

But it fails
when synonyms are used.

Vector search understands meaning.

But sometimes it misses
exact matches.

Hybrid search combines both.

This gives the best of both worlds.

Now let us understand the components.

First is BM25-style scoring.

BM25 scores documents
based on keyword frequency
and document length.

Second is vector similarity.

We convert text into vectors
and compute cosine similarity.

Finally,
we combine both scores.

Now let us look at the code.

We tokenize the query
and documents.

We compute a BM25-style score.

Then we compute vector similarity.

We add both scores
to get a hybrid score.

Documents are ranked
by this combined score.

This approach is used in:
Elasticsearch,
OpenSearch,
enterprise search engines,
and advanced RAG systems.

Hybrid search dramatically improves
answer accuracy and relevance.

In the next video,
we will make retrieval smarter
by adding metadata awareness.

That is how enterprise systems
filter by department,
date,
or document type.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
