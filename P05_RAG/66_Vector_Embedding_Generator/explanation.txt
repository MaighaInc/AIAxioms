Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

We are officially starting
PART 5 — RETRIEVAL AUGMENTED GENERATION.

This is one of the most important
parts of the entire course.

RAG is what allows AI
to use documents,
databases,
and enterprise knowledge.

Before we build chatbots over PDFs,
we must understand one thing.

Machines do not understand text.

They understand numbers.

Today’s topic is:
VECTOR EMBEDDING GENERATOR.

An embedding is a numerical
representation of text.

Similar text produces
similar vectors.

This is the foundation of:
semantic search,
document retrieval,
and RAG systems.

Now let us understand the intuition.

Imagine each sentence
is a point in space.

If two sentences
have similar meaning,
they appear close together.

Embeddings make this possible.

Now let us look at the code.

First,
we tokenize the text.

Then we build a vocabulary
from all documents.

Each unique word
becomes a dimension.

Then we convert each document
into a vector.

Each position in the vector
represents how many times
a word appears.

This is a simple embedding method.

Modern systems use neural embeddings,
but the idea is exactly the same.

Text becomes vectors.
Vectors can be compared.
Comparison enables retrieval.

Now let us look at the output.

Each document is converted
into a numeric vector.

These vectors can now be:
stored,
searched,
and compared.

Without embeddings,
RAG is impossible.

This lesson is the backbone
of everything coming next.

In the next video,
we will build a
VECTOR SEARCH ENGINE
using FAISS-style logic.

That is where retrieval begins.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
