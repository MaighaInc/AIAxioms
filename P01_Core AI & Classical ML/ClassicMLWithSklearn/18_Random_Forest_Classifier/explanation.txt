Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we learned about K-Means clustering,
which is an unsupervised algorithm.

Today we are coming back
to supervised learning,
but with a powerful upgrade.

Today’s topic is:
RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER.

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method.

Instead of using a single decision tree,
it uses many decision trees.

Now let us understand why this is needed.

Decision trees are easy to understand,
but they can overfit.

They memorize the training data
instead of learning general patterns.

Random Forest solves this problem
by combining many trees.

Each tree is trained
on a random subset of data
and random subset of features.

This randomness makes each tree different.

During prediction,
each tree votes,
and the majority vote is selected.

This is why it is called a forest.

Now let us look at the code.

We prepare a dataset
for loan approval prediction.

We split the data
into training and testing sets.

Then we create a RandomForestClassifier.

We specify:
number of trees,
maximum depth,
and random state.

After training,
we make predictions on test data.

We evaluate the model using:
accuracy,
confusion matrix,
and classification report.

Now let us talk about feature importance.

Random Forest automatically tells us
which features are most important.

This is extremely valuable in real projects.

Finally,
we test the model
with a new customer.

The model outputs
both prediction and probability.

Random Forest is widely used
because it is:
robust,
accurate,
and interpretable.

In the next video,
we will learn about Gradient Boosting,
which improves models sequentially.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
