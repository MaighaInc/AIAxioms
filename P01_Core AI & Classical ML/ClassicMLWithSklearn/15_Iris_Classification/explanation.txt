Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we learned about customer churn prediction.

Today we are working with
one of the most famous datasets
in machine learning history.

Today’s topic is:
IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION.

The Iris dataset is often
the first dataset used
to teach machine learning.

The goal is to classify flowers
into three species:
Setosa,
Versicolor,
and Virginica.

Each flower has four measurements:
sepal length,
sepal width,
petal length,
and petal width.

This is a multi-class classification problem,
which means the output
has more than two classes.

Now let us walk through the code.

First,
we load the Iris dataset
directly from scikit-learn.

This dataset is already clean
and ready to use.

Next,
we split the data
into training and testing sets.

This allows us to evaluate the model
on unseen data.

We then train a logistic regression model.

Logistic regression can handle
multi-class classification
using a method called softmax.

After training,
we make predictions on the test set.

We evaluate the model using:
accuracy,
confusion matrix,
and classification report.

The confusion matrix shows
how many flowers of each species
were correctly or incorrectly classified.

You will notice that
Setosa is almost always classified correctly,
while Versicolor and Virginica
are sometimes confused.

Finally,
we test the model
with a new flower measurement.

The model predicts
the species of the flower.

The Iris dataset is important
because it helps us understand:
feature importance,
class separation,
and evaluation metrics.

With this,
we have completed
the core supervised learning section.

In the next batch,
we will move into
dimensionality reduction,
clustering,
and ensemble models.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
