Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we learned about Random Forest,
which combines many trees in parallel.

Today we are learning
another powerful ensemble technique.

Today’s topic is:
GRADIENT BOOSTING MODEL.

The key idea of gradient boosting
is very simple.

Instead of training trees independently,
it trains trees one after another.

Each new tree focuses on
correcting the mistakes
made by previous trees.

This is why it is called boosting.

Now let us understand this intuitively.

Imagine a teacher teaching a student.

The first lesson covers basics.
The student makes mistakes.

The second lesson focuses
only on those mistakes.

The third lesson focuses
on remaining weak areas.

That is exactly how gradient boosting works.

Now let us look at the code.

We use a loan approval dataset,
similar to the previous examples.

First,
we split the data
into training and testing sets.

Then we create
a GradientBoostingClassifier.

We define:
number of trees,
learning rate,
and maximum depth.

Learning rate controls
how much each tree contributes.

Smaller learning rates
require more trees,
but give better performance.

After training,
we make predictions
on the test data.

We evaluate the model using:
accuracy,
confusion matrix,
and classification report.

We also print feature importance.

Just like Random Forest,
gradient boosting tells us
which features matter the most.

Finally,
we test the model
with a new customer.

The model outputs
both prediction and probability.

Gradient boosting is extremely powerful.

Many state-of-the-art models
like XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost
are based on this idea.

If you understand gradient boosting,
you understand one of the strongest
machine learning techniques.

In the next and final video,
we will build a model evaluation dashboard
to compare all our models visually.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
