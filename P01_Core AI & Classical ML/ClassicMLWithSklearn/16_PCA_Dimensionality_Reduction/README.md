PCA Dimensionality Reduction
============================

This project demonstrates how Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
reduces the number of features while retaining most information.

Requirements:
------------
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- numpy

Install dependencies:
---------------------
pip install numpy scikit-learn

How to Run:
-----------
1. Open terminal
2. Navigate to this folder
3. Run:

   python pca_dimensionality_reduction.py

Expected Output:
----------------
- Original and reduced data shape
- Explained variance ratio
- Total variance retained
- Feature contribution to each component

Learning Objective:
-------------------
Understand how PCA compresses data
and why it is used before modeling.
