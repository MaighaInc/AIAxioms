Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we built a house price prediction model
using numerical data.

Today we are moving into text data,
which is one of the most common
real-world machine learning problems.

Today’s topic is:
SPAM EMAIL CLASSIFIER USING MACHINE LEARNING.

Every day,
millions of spam emails are sent.
Manually filtering them is impossible.

So how does a machine do this?

First,
we must understand one important thing.

Machines do not understand text.
They only understand numbers.

So the first step in text classification
is converting text into numbers.

This process is called vectorization.

In our code,
we use CountVectorizer.

CountVectorizer converts text
into word-frequency vectors.

Each email becomes a list of numbers
representing how many times
each word appears.

Now let us walk through the code.

We first define a small dataset
containing spam and normal emails.

Next,
we create a CountVectorizer
and convert the emails into numeric features.

Then we split the data
into training and testing sets.

This ensures that the model
is evaluated on unseen emails.

Next,
we train a Naive Bayes classifier.

Naive Bayes works very well for text
because it handles word frequencies efficiently.

After training,
we make predictions on the test data.

We evaluate the model using:
accuracy,
confusion matrix,
and classification report.

The confusion matrix shows
how many spam emails
were correctly or incorrectly classified.

Finally,
we test the model with a new email:
Win free money now.

Words like win, free, and money
are strong indicators of spam.

So the model predicts Spam.

Spam classification is used
in email systems,
message filtering,
and content moderation.

In the next video,
we will build a credit risk scoring model,
which is widely used in banking and finance.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
