Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

This is a very special video,
because it is the final lesson
of our entire AI and Machine Learning course.

Today’s topic is:
MODEL EVALUATION DASHBOARD.

So far,
we have built many machine learning models.

But one very important question remains.

How do we decide
which model is better?

This is where model evaluation comes in.

In real-world projects,
accuracy alone is not enough.

Different models perform differently
depending on the problem.

Now let us understand the metrics.

Accuracy tells us
how many predictions were correct overall.

Precision tells us
how many predicted positives were actually correct.

Recall tells us
how many actual positives we correctly identified.

F1 score is a balance
between precision and recall.

Now let us look at the code.

We define a helper function
called evaluate_model.

This function takes a model
and returns all important metrics.

We then create a dataset
for loan approval prediction.

We split the data
into training and testing sets.

Next,
we define multiple models.

In our example,
we use Logistic Regression
and Random Forest.

Each model is trained
on the same training data.

This is very important
for fair comparison.

Then we evaluate each model
using the same test data.

The results are printed
in a dashboard-like format.

This allows us to easily compare models.

For example,
Logistic Regression may be simpler
and more interpretable.

Random Forest may be more accurate
and robust.

The choice depends on the business problem.

In regulated industries,
interpretability may be more important.

In performance-critical systems,
accuracy may matter more.

This is how real ML teams
make decisions.

With this final lesson,
you now understand the entire ML lifecycle:
from rules,
to learning,
to evaluation,
and decision making.

You are now fully equipped
to teach AI,
build projects,
and explain concepts clearly.

Thank you for completing this journey.
See you in the next advanced series.
