Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we learned about PCA,
which reduces data dimensions.

Today we are moving to
unsupervised learning.

Today’s topic is:
K-MEANS CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION.

Unsupervised learning means
there are no labels.

The algorithm must discover
patterns on its own.

Now let us understand the problem.

Businesses often want to group customers
based on behavior.

For example:
high spenders,
low spenders,
and average spenders.

But the data does not tell us
which customer belongs to which group.

K-Means solves this problem.

Now let us understand how K-Means works.

First,
we decide the number of clusters, K.

Then,
the algorithm randomly initializes
K cluster centers.

Next,
each data point is assigned
to the nearest cluster center.

Then,
cluster centers are updated
based on the mean of assigned points.

This process repeats
until cluster centers stop changing.

Now let us look at the code.

We use annual income
and spending score as features.

Before clustering,
we standardize the data.

This is very important.

Without scaling,
features with large values
dominate the clustering.

Now we apply K-Means
with three clusters.

The model assigns
each customer to a cluster.

We print the cluster assignments.

We also print cluster centers,
which represent average customers
in each segment.

Finally,
we test the model
with a new customer.

The model assigns the new customer
to the nearest cluster.

Customer segmentation is widely used
in marketing,
recommendation systems,
and personalization.

K-Means is simple and fast,
but it has limitations.

You must choose K carefully.

In the next video,
we will learn about Random Forest,
an ensemble learning algorithm.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
