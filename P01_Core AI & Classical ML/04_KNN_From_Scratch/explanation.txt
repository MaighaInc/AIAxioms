Hello everyone, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we discussed Naive Bayes,
which uses probability to make predictions.

Today we are learning a very different algorithm.

Today’s topic is:
K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS,
also known as KNN.

This algorithm is very simple,
but extremely important for understanding
distance-based learning.

KNN does not learn a model.
There is no training phase.

Instead,
it stores all the data in memory.

When a new data point arrives,
it compares that point
to all existing data points.

Now let us understand the idea intuitively.

Imagine you move to a new city
and want to know if an area is safe.

You look at nearby houses
and see how the neighbors are.

If most neighbors are friendly,
you assume the area is safe.

That is exactly how KNN works.

Now let us look at the code.

We created a class called KNNClassifier.

Inside the constructor,
we define the value of K,
which is the number of neighbors to consider.

The fit function does nothing but store the data.
That is why KNN is called a lazy learning algorithm.

Now the most important function is predict.

First,
we calculate the distance between
the test point and every training point.

We use Euclidean distance,
which is the straight-line distance.

Then we sort the distances
and select the K closest neighbors.

From these neighbors,
we take a majority vote.

Whichever class appears most,
becomes the prediction.

In our example,
we use K equal to 3.

The test point is close to class A points,
so the model predicts class A.

Now let us talk about advantages of KNN.

It is very simple.
It makes no assumptions about data.
It can model complex boundaries.

But it also has disadvantages.

It is slow for large datasets.
It requires storing all data.
It is sensitive to feature scaling.

Choosing the right value of K
is very important.

Small K can cause noise.
Large K can oversmooth decisions.

In the next video,
we will move to Linear Regression,
where models actually learn parameters.

If you understand KNN,
you now understand instance-based learning.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
