Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we built a spam email classifier.

Today we are moving into
one of the most important applications
of machine learning in the real world.

Today’s topic is:
CREDIT RISK SCORING MODEL.

Banks and financial institutions
use credit risk models
to decide whether to approve loans.

The goal is simple:
Predict whether a customer
will repay the loan or default.

This is a binary classification problem.

Now let us understand the data.

We use four features:
age,
annual income,
loan amount,
and credit score.

The output is:
0 for high risk,
1 for low risk.

Now let us walk through the code.

First,
we prepare the dataset
using numpy arrays.

Then we split the data
into training and testing sets.

This ensures the model
is evaluated properly.

Next,
we train a logistic regression model.

Logistic regression is widely used
in finance because it outputs probabilities.

After training,
we make predictions
on the test data.

We evaluate the model using:
accuracy,
confusion matrix,
and classification report.

Now let us talk about probability.

Instead of only predicting
high risk or low risk,
the model also tells us
how confident it is.

This probability is extremely important.

For example,
a bank may approve loans
only if probability is above 70 percent.

Finally,
we test the model
with a new customer.

The model outputs
the probability of being low risk
and the final decision.

Credit risk models are regulated,
interpretable,
and critical for financial stability.

In the next video,
we will build a customer churn prediction model,
which is widely used by subscription companies.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
