Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

Today we are going to start our AI journey from the very beginning.
Before machine learning, before neural networks, and before deep learning.

Today’s topic is:
RULE-BASED EXPERT SYSTEM.

So first, let me explain what an expert system is.

An expert system is a type of artificial intelligence
that tries to behave like a human expert.
But instead of learning from data,
it follows rules written by humans.

These rules are written in a very simple form:
IF something is true, THEN do something.

This is exactly how early AI systems worked.

Now let’s understand this with a real-world example.

Imagine a doctor diagnosing a patient.
The doctor does not use machine learning.
The doctor uses experience and rules.

For example:
If the patient has high fever,
and cough,
and headache,
then the doctor might say it is flu.

This logic is exactly what we are coding here.

Now let us open the Python file.

The first thing you will notice is a function called
diagnose_patient.

This function takes four inputs:
temperature,
cough,
headache,
and fatigue.

These are called facts.
In expert systems, input information is called facts.

Inside the function, we define rules.

Rule number one checks:
If temperature is greater than or equal to 38 degrees,
and the patient has cough,
and headache,
and fatigue,
then the diagnosis is Flu.

This is the strongest rule,
so it is written first.

Rule number two checks:
If temperature is above 37
and the patient has cough,
then the diagnosis is Common Cold.

Finally, if none of the rules match,
the system says the patient is Healthy.

Now this is very important:
The order of rules matters.

The system checks rules from top to bottom.
The first matching rule decides the output.

This means if two rules could match,
only the first one is applied.

Now let us look at the main function.

Here we define a sample patient.
The temperature is 38.5 degrees.
The patient has cough.
The patient has headache.
The patient has fatigue.

These values are passed to the diagnose_patient function.

The function checks the rules one by one.
Rule one matches all conditions,
so the system returns Flu.

The program then prints the diagnosis result.

Now let us talk about intelligence.

Is this system intelligent?
The answer is no.

It does not learn.
It does not improve.
It does not adapt.

It only follows rules written by humans.

So what are the advantages of rule-based systems?

Number one:
They are easy to understand.

Number two:
Every decision can be explained clearly.

Number three:
They work well for small and stable problems.

Now what are the disadvantages?

As the number of rules increases,
the system becomes difficult to manage.

If rules conflict,
the system can give wrong results.

Most importantly,
the system cannot learn from new data.

Because of these limitations,
rule-based AI could not scale.

And this is exactly why machine learning was invented.

In the next video,
we will see how machines learn rules automatically
using Decision Trees.

So this video is very important
because it builds the foundation of AI thinking.

If you understand this concept clearly,
machine learning will become much easier.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
