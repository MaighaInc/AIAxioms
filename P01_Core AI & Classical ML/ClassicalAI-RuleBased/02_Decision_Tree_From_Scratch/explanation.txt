Hello everyone, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we discussed rule-based expert systems,
where humans write all the rules manually.

Today we are taking the next step in AI evolution.

Our topic today is:
DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER.

A decision tree is an AI model
that learns rules automatically from data.

Instead of humans writing rules,
the machine decides what questions to ask.

Let us understand this with an example.

Suppose a company wants to predict
whether a customer will buy a product.

The company collects data like:
age of the customer,
income of the customer,
and past buying behavior.

From this data,
the decision tree learns patterns.

Now let us look at the Python code.

We have a function called decision_tree_predict.
This function takes two inputs:
age and income.

The first condition checks:
If age is less than 30,
the model predicts No.

This is the root of the tree.
In a decision tree,
the first question is the most important one.

If the age is greater than or equal to 30,
we move to the next level.

Now the second condition checks income.
If income is greater than or equal to 50,000,
the model predicts Yes.
Otherwise, it predicts No.

Each if-else block represents a node in the tree.

The top condition is the root node.
The inner conditions are child nodes.
The final outputs are leaf nodes.

Now let us talk about how this is different
from rule-based systems.

In rule-based systems,
humans write the rules.

In decision trees,
the machine learns these rules from data.

That is a very big shift in AI.

Decision trees are easy to understand
because the decisions can be traced step by step.

However, decision trees also have limitations.

If the tree becomes too deep,
it starts memorizing data.
This problem is called overfitting.

To solve this,
advanced models like Random Forest
use many decision trees together.

But understanding a single decision tree
is very important before moving forward.

In the next video,
we will talk about Naive Bayes,
which uses probability instead of rules.

If you understand decision trees clearly,
you are now officially learning machine learning.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
