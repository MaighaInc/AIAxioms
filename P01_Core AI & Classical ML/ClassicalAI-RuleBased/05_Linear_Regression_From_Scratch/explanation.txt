Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

So far, we have learned algorithms
that make decisions using rules,
probability,
and distance.

Today we are learning something very important.

Today’s topic is:
LINEAR REGRESSION FROM SCRATCH.

This is the foundation of machine learning.

Linear regression answers a very simple question:
How does one value change when another value changes?

For example:
If study hours increase,
how does exam score increase?

If years of experience increase,
how does salary increase?

Now let us look at the mathematical idea,
but in a simple way.

Linear regression assumes
there is a straight-line relationship
between input and output.

The formula is:
y equals w times x plus b.

Here,
w is called weight or slope.
b is called bias or intercept.

The goal of the model
is to learn the best values of w and b.

Now the question is:
How does the model learn?

The answer is:
By making mistakes.

The model starts with random values
for weight and bias.

It makes a prediction.
It compares the prediction with the actual value.
The difference is called error.

The model then adjusts the weight and bias
to reduce this error.

This process is called gradient descent.

Now let us look at the code.

We created a class called LinearRegression.

Inside the constructor,
we define learning rate and number of epochs.

Learning rate controls
how big the update steps are.
Epochs define
how many times we repeat learning.

The predict function applies
the linear equation.

The train function is where learning happens.

For every data point,
we calculate prediction and error.

Then we update weight and bias
using the error.

This update moves the model
closer to the correct line.

We also calculate loss,
which shows how wrong the model is overall.

Every 100 epochs,
we print the loss.

You will notice that
the loss keeps decreasing.

This means the model is learning.

After training,
we print the learned weight and bias.

Since our data follows
y equals 2x,
the weight should be close to 2.

Finally,
we test the model
by predicting the output for a new value.

This is real machine learning.

The model was not given the formula.
It discovered the relationship on its own.

Linear regression is extremely important
because almost every advanced AI model
uses the same learning principle.

In the next video,
we will move to Logistic Regression,
which is used for classification.

If you understand linear regression deeply,
machine learning will feel much easier.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
