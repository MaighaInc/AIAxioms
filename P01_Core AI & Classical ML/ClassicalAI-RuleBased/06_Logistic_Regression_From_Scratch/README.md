Logistic Regression From Scratch
================================

This project demonstrates how logistic regression
performs binary classification using probabilities.

Requirements:
------------
- Python 3.x

How to Run:
-----------
1. Open terminal
2. Navigate to this folder
3. Run:

   python logistic_regression_from_scratch.py

Expected Output:
----------------
- Loss decreasing over epochs
- Learned weight and bias
- Probability and class prediction

Learning Objective:
-------------------
Understand how classification models
learn decision boundaries using gradient descent.
