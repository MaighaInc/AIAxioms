Requirements:
------------
- Python 3.x

How to Run:
-----------
1. Open terminal / command prompt
2. Navigate to this folder

The system will display patient symptoms and give a diagnosis such as:
- Flu
- Common Cold
- Healthy

Learning Objective:
-------------------
Understand how early AI systems worked using human-written rules without any machine learning.
