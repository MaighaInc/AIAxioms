Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we built long-term vector memory.

That memory stored facts.

Today we move to
event-based memory.

Today’s topic is:
EPISODIC MEMORY SYSTEM.

Episodic memory stores experiences.

It answers questions like:
What happened?
When did it happen?
What was the context?

This is different from factual memory.

For example:
Fact memory says:
The user likes Python.

Episodic memory says:
Yesterday, the user asked for Python examples.

Now let us understand the structure.

Each memory episode contains:
a description,
a timestamp,
and context.

When a new query arrives,
we search across episodes
using vector similarity.

This allows the AI
to recall relevant past events.

Now let us look at the code.

We store events
with timestamps.

We convert both the query
and events into vectors.

Then we compute similarity
to find the most relevant events.

This approach is used in:
autonomous agents,
task planning systems,
and reflective AI.

Episodic memory allows AI
to reason over past actions.

In the next video,
we will introduce
MEMORY DECAY AND REINFORCEMENT.

This allows AI to forget
unimportant memories
and strengthen useful ones.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the next video.
