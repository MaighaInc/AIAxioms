Hello guys, welcome back to the channel.

In the previous video,
we added citations to RAG responses.

Today we focus on user experience.

Today’s topic is:
STREAMING RAG RESPONSES.

When you use ChatGPT,
the answer appears gradually.

This is called streaming.

Streaming makes systems feel faster,
more responsive,
and more human.

Now let us understand
why streaming matters.

Even if a response
takes two seconds to generate,
users prefer to see output immediately.

Streaming improves perceived speed.

Now let us look at the pipeline.

First,
we retrieve relevant documents.

Second,
we generate the answer.

Instead of waiting
for the full answer,
we stream it piece by piece.

Now let us look at the code.

We retrieve relevant chunks.

We combine them
to form the answer text.

Then we print each word
with a small delay.

This simulates token streaming.

Real LLMs stream tokens
as they are generated.

This same idea applies
to RAG systems.

Streaming is used in:
chat interfaces,
assistants,
and conversational search.

In the next and final video
of PART 5,
we will build
an enterprise knowledge assistant.

This combines everything:
retrieval,
metadata,
citations,
streaming,
and safety.

Thank you for watching.
See you in the final video.
